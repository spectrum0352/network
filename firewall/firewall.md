# Introduction

A firewall is a network security device that acts as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks. It monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. By inspecting each data packet, firewalls determine whether to allow or block it based on factors like IP addresses, port numbers, and traffic type.

**What is a Firewall?**

- A security device that inspects network traffic

- Protects networks from unauthorized access and malicious threats

**Azure Firewall Summary**

- **Centralized management:** Allows for easy policy enforcement and logging across multiple environments.

- **Cloud-based network security service:** Protects Azure Virtual Network resources.

- **Default traffic blocking:** Requires explicit rules to allow traffic.

- **East-west and north-south traffic inspection:** Monitors both internal and external network traffic.

- **Fully stateful firewall:** Provides granular control over network traffic.

- **High availability and scalability:** Offers reliable and flexible performance.

- **Integrated with Azure Monitor:** Provides comprehensive logging and analytics capabilities.

- **Managed service:** Azure handles the underlying infrastructure.

## How Does a Firewall Work?

1.  **Packet Inspection:** Examines each data packet for information like:

    - Source and destination IP addresses

    - Port numbers

    - Protocol type

    - Content type

2.  **Rule-Based Decision:** Compares packet information to a set of pre-defined rules

3.  **Allow or Block:**

    - Allows benign traffic to pass through

    - Blocks malicious or unauthorized traffic

## Initial Configuration

1.  Planning and Assessment:

    - Asset Identification:

      - Identify critical systems, data, and applications.

      - Categorize assets based on sensitivity and importance.

    - Risk Assessment:

      - Determine potential threats (e.g., malware, unauthorized access, data breaches).

      - Analyze vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

      - Understand the potential impact of security breaches.

2.  Security Policy Definition:

    - Establish clear rules for allowed and blocked traffic.

    - Specify protocols and ports (e.g., HTTPS, SSH, RDP, SQL).

    - Define how different traffic types are handled (e.g., inspection, logging, blocking).

    - Align policies with organizational security standards and compliance requirements.

3.  Network Segmentation (Firewall Zones):

    - Create logical zones based on security requirements (e.g., internal, external, DMZ).

    - Isolate sensitive resources by placing them in separate zones.

    - Example Zones:

      - Internal Network: For trusted devices and servers.

      - External Network: For internet-facing resources.

      - DMZ (Demilitarized Zone): For public-facing servers that require limited access to internal networks.

4.  Firewall Rule Configuration:

    - Implement rules to control traffic flow between zones.

    - Use the principle of least privilege (allow only necessary traffic).

    - Be specific with rules (source/destination IP addresses, ports, protocols).

    - Examples:

      - Allow HTTPS traffic from the internet to a web server in the DMZ.

      - Block RDP access from the internet to internal servers.

      - Allow all traffic between internal subnets.

5.  Testing and Validation:

    - Conduct thorough testing before deploying the configuration in production.

    - Perform vulnerability scans and penetration testing.

    - Verify that legitimate traffic is allowed and malicious traffic is blocked.

    - Test failover and high availability scenarios.

6.  Basic Details Configuration:

    - Subscription Selection.

    - Resource Group Assignment.

    - Firewall Policy Naming and Regional Location.

    - Parent Policy Implementation.

7.  DNS Settings:

    - DNS Server Configuration:

      - Use Azure-provided DNS or configure custom DNS servers.

      - Ensure DNS resolution is reliable and secure.

    - DNS Proxy: Configure if needed for DNS traffic inspection.

    - Azure Firewall DNS settings: configure the firewall to act as a DNS proxy.

## Best Practices

- Default Deny Policy: Start with a policy that blocks all traffic and only allow necessary exceptions.

- Least Privilege: Grant only the minimum necessary permissions.

- Logging and Monitoring: Enable comprehensive logging to track traffic and identify security incidents.

- Regular Updates: Keep the firewall firmware and software up to date.

- Security Professional Consultation: Seek expert assistance if needed.

## Example Configuration (Hub-Spoke Model)

This example shows a common network architecture used in large enterprises.

- Scenario: A hub-spoke network with a central firewall in the hub virtual network.

- Components:

  - Hub Virtual Network (VNet-Hub):

    - Address space: 10.0.0.0/16

    - Subnet: AzureFirewallSubnet (10.0.0.0/24)

    - Resource Group: RG-Hub

    - Resource: Az-FW (Azure Firewall)

  - Spoke Virtual Network (VNet-Spoke):

    - Address space: 10.1.0.0/16

    - Subnet: devsubnet (10.1.0.0/24)

    - Resource Group: RG-Spoke

    - Resource: Az-VM (Virtual Machine)

- Firewall Rules (Example):

  - Allow outbound HTTPS (port 443) and HTTP (port 80) traffic from VNet-Spoke to the internet.

  - Allow inbound SSH (port 22) traffic from a specific administrator IP address to Az-VM.

  - Allow traffic between the hub and spoke networks.

  - Block all other inbound traffic from the internet.

  - DNS configuration: Use custom DNS servers located in the hub network, and enable DNS proxy.

  - Implement threat intelligence filtering on the firewall.

  - Configure Network address translation (NAT) rules as required.

- Implementation Notes:

  - Use User Defined Routes (UDRs) to route traffic from spoke VNets to the Azure Firewall in the hub VNet.

  - Implement Network Security Groups (NSGs) at the subnet level for granular traffic filtering.

  - Centralized logging of the firewall logs to a security information and event management (SIEM) system.

  - Implement Azure Firewall Manager for centralized management of multiple firewalls.

## Azure CLI

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

1.  **Variables:** Using variables at the beginning of the script makes it easier to modify and maintain.

2.  **Resource Group and VNet Creation:** The script creates the resource groups and virtual networks with their respective subnets.

3.  **Public IP and Azure Firewall Creation:** It creates a public IP for the firewall and then deploys the Azure Firewall into the hub VNet's AzureFirewallSubnet.

4.  **Subnet and Public IP ID retrieval:** The script now retrieves the Subnet IDs and the Public IP ID using az network vnet subnet show and az network public-ip show and stores them in variables. This is crucial for linking resources.

5.  **Firewall Private IP Retrieval:** The script retrieves the private IP address of the firewall, which is needed for the route table.

6.  **VM Creation:** The script creates a virtual machine in the spoke VNet using the created network interface.

7.  **Route Table and Route Creation:** The script creates a route table and a route to direct traffic from the spoke VNet to the Azure Firewall's private IP.

8.  **Subnet Association:** The script associates the route table with the spoke VNet's subnet.

9.  **Password Handling:** **Important:** Replace "YourStrongPassword!" with a strong, secure password. For production environments, consider using Azure Key Vault to manage secrets.

10. **Username:** replace "azureuser" with your desired username.

**How to Run the Script:**

1.  **Azure CLI:** Ensure you have the Azure CLI installed and configured.

2.  **Login:** Log in to your Azure account using az login.

## Firewall Deployment

- **Placement:**

  - Perimeter: At the network edge to protect against external threats.

  - Internal: To segment the internal network.

- **Azure Deployment:** Specific steps for configuring rules in the Azure Portal.

- **Number of Firewalls:** Factors influencing the number of firewalls required:

  - Network size and complexity

  - Data sensitivity

  - Organizational security policies

  - Threat landscape

  - Cost-benefit analysis

- **Deployment Strategies:**

  - Phased deployment

  - Pilot testing

# Policies

## 1. Core Concepts: Network Firewall Policies

- Definition:

  - Network firewall policies are sets of rules that control network traffic flow.

  - They determine which traffic is allowed or blocked based on various criteria.

- Key Factors for Policy Decisions:

  - Source and destination IP addresses

  - Protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP)

  - Port numbers

- Purpose:

  - To secure a network by filtering traffic.

  - To prevent unauthorized access.

## 2. Types of Firewall Policies

- Core Policies:

  - Fundamental rules defining allowed and blocked protocols.

  - The foundation of network security.

- System Policies:

  - Manage traffic to and from the firewall itself.

  - Essential for management, monitoring, VPN, and DNS.

- Application Policies:

  - Control traffic for specific applications.

  - Restrict access, prioritize traffic, and enhance security.

- Content Policies:

  - Control traffic based on packet content.

  - Block malicious traffic and filter unwanted content.

- Default Policies:

  - Pre-configured by vendors, often allowing all traffic.

  - Highly discouraged for production environments due to security risks.

- Stateful vs. Stateless Policies:

  - Stateful: Tracks connection states for enhanced security.

  - Stateless: Evaluates each packet independently, simpler but less secure.

- Hierarchical Policies:

  - Organize rules in a hierarchy for complex environments.

  - Improve manageability and scalability.

- Zone-Based Policies:

  - Divide the network into zones with specific security rules for each zone.

  - Example zones: internal, external, DMZ.

- Web Filtering Policies:

  - Block access to specific websites or categories of websites.

- VPN Policies:

  - Configure secure tunnels for remote access.

- IDS/IPS Policies:

  - IDS (Intrusion Detection System): Detects and alerts on suspicious activity.

  - IPS (Intrusion Prevention System): Actively blocks or mitigates threats.

- Network Rules:

  - Rules that filter based on network layer information (IP addresses, protocols, ports).

- Application Rules:

  - Rules that filter based on application layer information (specific applications).

- DNAT Rules:

  - Destination Network Address Translation rules, used to redirect traffic to different internal servers.

## 3. Firewall Zoning

- Definition:

  - Segmenting a network into zones based on trust levels.

- Zone Examples:

  - Internal Zone (High Trust): User workstations, servers.

  - External Zone (Low Trust): Internet-connected devices.

  - DMZ (Demilitarized Zone): Publicly accessible servers (web, email).

- Benefits:

  - Reduced attack surface.

  - Contained malware spread.

  - Improved compliance.

- DMZ Security Best Practices:

  - Use two firewalls: one internet-facing, one internal-facing.

  - Use different firewall types for added security.

  - Use dual NICs for DMZ servers.

  - Maintain separate rule sets.

## 4. Security Practices

- Egress Filtering:

  - Allow only authorized traffic to leave the network.

  - Log or drop unauthorized outbound traffic.

- Web Content Filtering:

  - Block access to malicious or inappropriate websites.

- Application Control:

  - Restrict software execution to prevent malware.

- Change Management:

  - Formal process for firewall modifications:

    - Request, review, and analyze changes.

    - Test changes in a controlled environment.

    - Deploy and verify changes.

    - Document all changes.

- Traffic Filtering:

  - Default "deny all" policy.

  - Explicitly allow necessary traffic.

  - Filter out unwanted traffic.

  - Monitor and log suspicious traffic.

- Explicit Drop Rule:

  - Implement a "drop all" rule at the end of each security zone.

  - Log blocked traffic for analysis.

- Remove "Accept All" Rules:

  - Avoid "accept all" rules, as they create security vulnerabilities.

- Defense in Depth:

  - Firewall is one component of a layered security approach.

  - Integrate with IDS/IPS, OS security, etc.

- Rulesets:

  - Tailor rulesets to specific organizational needs.

  - Mandatory rules (e.g., blocking private addresses).

- Port Policy:

  - Restrict unnecessary ports.

  - Verify service requirements before blocking.

  - Use secure alternatives (e.g., SSH instead of Telnet).

## 5. Network Policy vs. Firewall Policy

- Network Policy:

  - A broader set of rules governing overall network behavior.

  - May include routing, QoS, and other network-level configurations.

- Firewall Policy:

  - Specifically focuses on controlling traffic flow through the firewall.

  - A subset of the overall network policy.

- Service Access Policy:

  - Specifies which services are allowed to be accessed, and by whom.

- Firewall Design Policy:

  - Defines the overall architecture, placement, and configuration of firewalls within the network.

## Network Rules

To create a policy, you will. An **Azure Firewall Policy** is composed of rule collection groups.

- **Rule collection group**: It is a collection of related rules. First create at least one rule collection then create rules with conditions.

## DNAT Rules

**I. Summary**

The provided text offers a comprehensive overview of network firewalls, covering core principles, configuration processes, specific examples (like Azure and Git), policy considerations (web services, filtering, etc.), and deployment strategies. It emphasizes the "Principle of Least Privilege," the importance of accurate port/protocol/FQDN identification, and the need for a layered security approach.

## C. Firewall Policy

- **Core Principles:**

  - Principle of Least Privilege

  - Default Deny

  - Specificity of rules

  - No Implicit Allow

- **Rule Configuration:**

  - Whitelisting specific ports, protocols, services, and FQDNs.

  - Avoiding wildcard rules.

  - Regular review and updates.

- **Web Services Policy:**

  - Endpoint validation

  - Protocol restriction

  - Input validation

  - Rate limiting

  - IP whitelisting/blacklisting

  - Web Application Firewall (WAF)

  - Logging and monitoring

- **Filtering Policies:**

  - Web filtering policies

  - Application control policies

  - Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies

  - Zero-Trust policies

- **Basic Firewall Configuration:**

  - Blocking spoofed IPs

  - Blocking routing protocols

  - Port restrictions

  - ICMP restrictions

  - IP Masquerading

  - Zone transfer protection

  - Egress filtering

- **Advanced Firewall Features (Policy Implications):**

  - Application-Level Firewall

  - User Authentication

- **Firewall Management:**

  - Regular updates

  - Log analysis

  - Integration with other security systems

## III. Corrections and Clarifications

Here are some corrections and clarifications to the information:

- **FQDNs:**

  - It's crucial to emphasize that FQDN resolution (DNS) must be working correctly for FQDN-based rules to function.

  - Using FQDNs can add complexity, as IP addresses associated with a FQDN can change. Consider the dynamic nature of cloud environments.

- **Protocols:**

  - Be precise about protocols. TCP and UDP are transport layer protocols. HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, etc., are application layer protocols that use TCP or UDP.

  - For example, DNS primarily uses UDP port 53, but TCP port 53 is used for zone transfers.

- **Port Ranges:**

  - Document the *specific reason* for port ranges. Opening broad ranges increases risk. If possible, avoid ranges and use specific ports.

- **Azure PaaS:**

  - Service tags are indeed a best practice in Azure. They simplify management and automatically update when Microsoft changes the underlying IP addresses for Azure services.

- **Git Ports:**

  - Clarify that while port 9418 is used for the git:// protocol (which is insecure and rarely used), Git primarily operates over SSH (port 22) or HTTPS (port 443).

- **Web Services Policy:**

  - Emphasize the importance of API security best practices in web service firewall policies, such as input validation, output encoding, and authentication/authorization.

- **"Should be Restricted" Ports:**

  - The note that HTTP (port 80) "Should be Restricted" is a bit misleading. While HTTPS (port 443) is preferred for secure web traffic, HTTP is still used in many scenarios. The key is to have a policy that aligns with your security needs. If possible, redirect HTTP to HTTPS.

- **netstat and Task Manager:**

  - The instructions for using netstat and Task Manager are generally correct, but it's important to note that some processes might run under system accounts or other user accounts, which can make identification more challenging.

- **URL Filtering:**

  - URL filtering can be done at the firewall level or using separate proxy servers or security appliances.

- **ICMP:**

  - While allowing basic ICMP (like ping) is often useful for troubleshooting, be cautious about allowing all ICMP traffic, as some ICMP types can be used for attacks.

- **Opening Ports Securely:**

  - Emphasize the importance of regularly auditing firewall rules, removing unnecessary rules, and keeping the firewall software updated.

- **Firewall Rules:**

  - Firewall rules should be as specific as possible. Instead of opening a port for "any" source IP to "any" destination IP, specify the exact source and destination IP addresses or network ranges.

## IV. Key Improvements and Additional Points

- **Zero Trust:** Expand on Zero Trust. It's not just a policy; it's a security model that assumes no user or device, whether inside or outside the network perimeter, can be automatically trusted. Firewall policies play a crucial role in enforcing Zero Trust principles.

- **Micro-segmentation:** Discuss micro-segmentation, which involves creating very granular security zones within the data center or cloud environment. Firewalls, especially next-generation firewalls, are essential for micro-segmentation.

- **Threat Intelligence:** Mention the importance of integrating threat intelligence feeds into firewall policies. This allows the firewall to block traffic from known malicious sources.

- **Automation:** Highlight the role of automation in firewall management. Tools and scripts can be used to automate tasks like rule creation, updates, and auditing.

- **Context Awareness:** Emphasize the need for firewalls to be context-aware. This means that the firewall can make decisions based on factors like the user's identity, the device type, and the application being used.

- **Logging and Monitoring:**

  - Firewall logs are critical for security monitoring, incident response, and auditing.

  - Implement robust logging and monitoring solutions.

  - Use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to analyze firewall logs and detect security threats.

By incorporating these corrections, clarifications, and additional points, you can create a more accurate, comprehensive, and valuable resource on network firewalls.

## Sample Firewall Policy

The document you provided is a firewall policy. It outlines the security measures for a network firewall system. Here's a summary of the key points:

**General Firewall Guidelines**

**Physical and Logical Access**

- Physical access to the firewall should be restricted.

- The firewall should be in a controlled environment with appropriate power and cooling.

- Logical access should be restricted to authorized personnel only.

- Remote administration should be encrypted if used.

**System Backup**

- Regularly back up firewall configurations, software, logs, and operating system files.

**Upgrades and Patches**

- promptly apply vendor-recommended firewall patches.

- Evaluate the need for firewall upgrades and get approval before implementation.

- Verify proper operation after any upgrades.

**Logs and Audit Trails**

- Enable logging for firewall activity, audit trails, and system events.

- Review logs periodically or situationally depending on business needs.

- Archive logs for a set period and then securely dispose of them.

**Documentation**

- Document firewall operational procedures, backups, troubleshooting, log review, and housekeeping.

- Document firewall configurations confidentially, including network diagrams, IP addresses, routing tables, and firewall rules.

- Update documentation after any firewall changes.

**Encrypted Channels**

- Use encrypted channels (VPN, SSL, SSH) for communication between internal and external hosts.

- Securely distribute encryption keys before using encrypted channels.

**Enforcement**

- All staff must comply with the firewall policy.

- Report any security violations or misuse of IT systems.

- Ensure contractors and authorized parties comply with this policy.

- Assign local firewall administrators for branch offices.

# Administration

- Only authorized administrators can modify firewall rules.

- Firewall rules and connections should be reviewed periodically and removed if no longer needed.

- Users and application owners must be authorized for any firewall changes.

<!-- -->

- **Audit Logs:** Regularly review firewall logs to identify anomalies, unused rules, and false positives. Optimize firewall settings based on this data.

- **Firewall Updates:** Keep firewall software and firmware up-to-date to prevent vulnerabilities and maintain effectiveness.

- **Internal Modems:** Eliminate modems from the internal network as they pose a significant security risk and can bypass the firewall.

- **Application-Level Firewalls:** Ensure the operating system is secure before evaluating the application-level firewall due to their close relationship.

- **Use a centralized management system**. A centralized management system can help you to manage multiple firewalls for IoT devices more easily and efficiently.

- **Open Ports:** If unnecessary ports are open on the firewall, attackers can use them to send malicious traffic.

**Tricking Users:**

- **Social Engineering:** Attackers may manipulate people (e.g., through phishing emails) to click malicious links or download malware that can bypass security measures.

**Alternative Routes:**

- **VPNs:** Attackers might misuse VPNs designed for legitimate remote access to bypass restrictions.

- **Proxy Servers:** Proxy servers can be used to mask a user's location and potentially bypass firewall rules.

It is important to remember that these are just some examples, and new techniques are constantly emerging. Here are some security practices to counter these methods:

- **Strong Firewall Rules:** Regularly review and update firewall rules to close any gaps in security.

- **User Education:** Train employees to identify and avoid social engineering tactics.

- **Multi-Layered Security:** Use a combination of security measures, including firewalls, intrusion detection, and data encryption, to create a strong defense.

- **Patching Systems:** Keep all software and systems updated with the latest security patches.

# Incident Response

How can a firewall be used to detect and prevent unauthorized access to a network? What types of logs and alerts should be monitored?

What is worse in firewall detection, a false negative or a false positive? And why? Consider a scenario where a firewall is protecting an online banking system. Which would be more detrimental: a false negative that allows a malicious attack to bypass the firewall or a false positive that blocks legitimate customer transactions? Explain your reasoning.

      - Categorize assets based on sensitivity and importance.

    - Risk Assessment:

      - Determine potential threats (e.g., malware, unauthorized access, data breaches).

      - Analyze vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

      - Understand the potential impact of security breaches.

9.  Security Policy Definition:

    - Establish clear rules for allowed and blocked traffic.

    - Specify protocols and ports (e.g., HTTPS, SSH, RDP, SQL).

    - Define how different traffic types are handled (e.g., inspection, logging, blocking).

    - Align policies with organizational security standards and compliance requirements.

10. Network Segmentation (Firewall Zones):

    - Create logical zones based on security requirements (e.g., internal, external, DMZ).

    - Isolate sensitive resources by placing them in separate zones.

    - Example Zones:

      - Internal Network: For trusted devices and servers.

      - External Network: For internet-facing resources.

      - DMZ (Demilitarized Zone): For public-facing servers that require limited access to internal networks.

11. Firewall Rule Configuration:

    - Implement rules to control traffic flow between zones.

    - Use the principle of least privilege (allow only necessary traffic).

    - Be specific with rules (source/destination IP addresses, ports, protocols).

    - Examples:

      - Allow HTTPS traffic from the internet to a web server in the DMZ.

      - Block RDP access from the internet to internal servers.

      - Allow all traffic between internal subnets.

12. Testing and Validation:

    - Conduct thorough testing before deploying the configuration in production.

    - Perform vulnerability scans and penetration testing.

    - Verify that legitimate traffic is allowed and malicious traffic is blocked.

    - Test failover and high availability scenarios.

13. Basic Details Configuration:

    - Subscription Selection.

    - Resource Group Assignment.

    - Firewall Policy Naming and Regional Location.

    - Parent Policy Implementation.

- Least Privilege: Grant only the minimum necessary permissions.

- Logging and Monitoring: Enable comprehensive logging to track traffic and identify security incidents.

- Regular Updates: Keep the firewall firmware and software up to date.

- Security Professional Consultation: Seek expert assistance if needed.

## Example Configuration (Hub-Spoke Model)

This example shows a common network architecture used in large enterprises.

- Scenario: A hub-spoke network with a central firewall in the hub virtual network.

- Components:

  - Hub Virtual Network (VNet-Hub):

    - Address space: 10.0.0.0/16

    - Subnet: AzureFirewallSubnet (10.0.0.0/24)

    - Resource Group: RG-Hub

    - Resource: Az-FW (Azure Firewall)

  - Spoke Virtual Network (VNet-Spoke):

    - Address space: 10.1.0.0/16

    - Subnet: devsubnet (10.1.0.0/24)

    - Resource Group: RG-Spoke

    - Resource: Az-VM (Virtual Machine)

- Firewall Rules (Example):

  - Allow outbound HTTPS (port 443) and HTTP (port 80) traffic from VNet-Spoke to the internet.

  - Allow inbound SSH (port 22) traffic from a specific administrator IP address to Az-VM.

  - Allow traffic between the hub and spoke networks.

  - Block all other inbound traffic from the internet.

  - DNS configuration: Use custom DNS servers located in the hub network, and enable DNS proxy.

  - Implement threat intelligence filtering on the firewall.

  - Configure Network address translation (NAT) rules as required.

- Implementation Notes:

  - Use User Defined Routes (UDRs) to route traffic from spoke VNets to the Azure Firewall in the hub VNet.

  - Implement Network Security Groups (NSGs) at the subnet level for granular traffic filtering.

  - Centralized logging of the firewall logs to a security information and event management (SIEM) system.

  - Implement Azure Firewall Manager for centralized management of multiple firewalls.

## Azure CLI

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

11. **Variables:** Using variables at the beginning of the script makes it easier to modify and maintain.

12. **Resource Group and VNet Creation:** The script creates the resource groups and virtual networks with their respective subnets.

13. **Public IP and Azure Firewall Creation:** It creates a public IP for the firewall and then deploys the Azure Firewall into the hub VNet's AzureFirewallSubnet.

14. **Subnet and Public IP ID retrieval:** The script now retrieves the Subnet IDs and the Public IP ID using az network vnet subnet show and az network public-ip show and stores them in variables. This is crucial for linking resources.

15. **Firewall Private IP Retrieval:** The script retrieves the private IP address of the firewall, which is needed for the route table.

16. **VM Creation:** The script creates a virtual machine in the spoke VNet using the created network interface.

17. **Route Table and Route Creation:** The script creates a route table and a route to direct traffic from the spoke VNet to the Azure Firewall's private IP.

18. **Subnet Association:** The script associates the route table with the spoke VNet's subnet.

19. **Password Handling:** **Important:** Replace "YourStrongPassword!" with a strong, secure password. For production environments, consider using Azure Key Vault to manage secrets.

20. **Username:** replace "azureuser" with your desired username.

**How to Run the Script:**

6.  **Azure CLI:** Ensure you have the Azure CLI installed and configured.

7.  **Login:** Log in to your Azure account using az login.

8.  **Save:** Save the script to a file (e.g., deploy_azfw.sh).

9.  **Permissions:** Make the script executable: chmod +x deploy_azfw.sh.

10. **Run:** Execute the script: ./deploy_azfw.sh.

# Policies

## 1. Core Concepts: Network Firewall Policies

- Definition:

  - Network firewall policies are sets of rules that control network traffic flow.

  - They determine which traffic is allowed or blocked based on various criteria.

- Key Factors for Policy Decisions:

  - Source and destination IP addresses

  - Protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP)

  - Port numbers

- Purpose:

  - To secure a network by filtering traffic.

  - To prevent unauthorized access.

## 2. Types of Firewall Policies

- Core Policies:

  - Fundamental rules defining allowed and blocked protocols.

  - The foundation of network security.

- System Policies:

  - Manage traffic to and from the firewall itself.

  - Essential for management, monitoring, VPN, and DNS.

- Application Policies:

  - Control traffic for specific applications.

  - Restrict access, prioritize traffic, and enhance security.

- Content Policies:

  - Control traffic based on packet content.

  - Block malicious traffic and filter unwanted content.

- Default Policies:

  - Pre-configured by vendors, often allowing all traffic.

  - Highly discouraged for production environments due to security risks.

- Stateful vs. Stateless Policies:

  - Stateful: Tracks connection states for enhanced security.

  - Stateless: Evaluates each packet independently, simpler but less secure.

- Hierarchical Policies:

  - Organize rules in a hierarchy for complex environments.

  - Improve manageability and scalability.

- Zone-Based Policies:

  - Divide the network into zones with specific security rules for each zone.

  - Example zones: internal, external, DMZ.

- Web Filtering Policies:

  - Block access to specific websites or categories of websites.

- VPN Policies:

  - Configure secure tunnels for remote access.

- IDS/IPS Policies:

  - IDS (Intrusion Detection System): Detects and alerts on suspicious activity.

  - IPS (Intrusion Prevention System): Actively blocks or mitigates threats.

- Network Rules:

  - Rules that filter based on network layer information (IP addresses, protocols, ports).

- Application Rules:

  - Rules that filter based on application layer information (specific applications).

- DNAT Rules:

  - Destination Network Address Translation rules, used to redirect traffic to different internal servers.

## 3. Firewall Zoning

- Definition:

  - Segmenting a network into zones based on trust levels.

- Zone Examples:

  - Internal Zone (High Trust): User workstations, servers.

  - External Zone (Low Trust): Internet-connected devices.

  - DMZ (Demilitarized Zone): Publicly accessible servers (web, email).

- Benefits:

  - Reduced attack surface.

  - Contained malware spread.

  - Improved compliance.

- DMZ Security Best Practices:

  - Use two firewalls: one internet-facing, one internal-facing.

  - Use different firewall types for added security.

  - Use dual NICs for DMZ servers.

  - Maintain separate rule sets.

## 4. Security Practices

- Egress Filtering:

  - Allow only authorized traffic to leave the network.

  - Log or drop unauthorized outbound traffic.

- Web Content Filtering:

  - Block access to malicious or inappropriate websites.

- Application Control:

  - Restrict software execution to prevent malware.

- Change Management:

  - Formal process for firewall modifications:

    - Request, review, and analyze changes.

    - Test changes in a controlled environment.

    - Deploy and verify changes.

    - Document all changes.

- Traffic Filtering:

  - Default "deny all" policy.

  - Explicitly allow necessary traffic.

  - Filter out unwanted traffic.

  - Monitor and log suspicious traffic.

- Explicit Drop Rule:

  - Implement a "drop all" rule at the end of each security zone.

  - Log blocked traffic for analysis.

- Remove "Accept All" Rules:

  - Avoid "accept all" rules, as they create security vulnerabilities.

- Defense in Depth:

  - Firewall is one component of a layered security approach.

  - Integrate with IDS/IPS, OS security, etc.

- Rulesets:

  - Tailor rulesets to specific organizational needs.

  - Mandatory rules (e.g., blocking private addresses).

- Port Policy:

  - Restrict unnecessary ports.

  - Verify service requirements before blocking.

  - Use secure alternatives (e.g., SSH instead of Telnet).

## Network Policy vs. Firewall Policy

- Network Policy:

  - A broader set of rules governing overall network behavior.

  - May include routing, QoS, and other network-level configurations.

- Firewall Policy:

  - Specifically focuses on controlling traffic flow through the firewall.

  - A subset of the overall network policy.

- Service Access Policy:

  - Specifies which services are allowed to be accessed, and by whom.

- Firewall Design Policy:

  - Defines the overall architecture, placement, and configuration of firewalls within the network.

# Network Rules vs Applications Rules for WindowsUpdate and Azure Monitor

To allow **outbound connectivity through Azure Firewall** for **Windows Updates** and **Azure Monitor**, you need to configure **both network and/or application rules**, depending on the **type of traffic and destination**.

Here’s a breakdown of what rules to configure and their prerequisites:

## 🔷 1. Application Rules (Preferred when FQDNs are available)

**Use Case:** When destination endpoints are accessible via **FQDNs (Fully Qualified Domain Names)** such as for Windows Updates and Azure Monitor endpoints.

**✅ Required for:**

- **Windows Update**

- **Azure Monitor**

- **Azure AD (if monitoring uses it)**

- **Microsoft Defender ATP (if used)**

**🛠️ Pre-requisites:**

- **DNS resolution** must be set up:

  - Azure Firewall must be able to resolve external FQDNs.

  - Ensure you have a **custom DNS or Azure DNS** in your Virtual Network settings.

### 🔧 Examples of Application Rules:

Name: Allow-Windows-Updates

Protocol: HTTPS:443

Target FQDNs:

\- \*.windowsupdate.com

\- \*.update.microsoft.com

\- \*.dl.delivery.mp.microsoft.com

\- \*.delivery.mp.microsoft.com

Name: Allow-Azure-Monitor

Protocol: HTTPS:443

Target FQDNs:

\- \*.monitor.azure.com

\- \*.ods.opinsights.azure.com

\- \*.oms.opinsights.azure.com

\- \*.azure-automation.net

## 🔶 2. Network Rules (Used when IPs or non-HTTP/S protocols are needed)

**Use Case:** When services use **fixed IPs, ports**, or **non-HTTP/S protocols** (like NTP, DNS, etc.)

**✅ Required for:**

- **NTP traffic** (UDP:123)

- **DNS resolution** (UDP/TCP:53)

- **Windows Activation** (optional)

**🛠️ Pre-requisites:**

- You need to know the **destination IP ranges or service tags**.

- Use **Service Tags** when possible (e.g., AzureMonitor, WindowsUpdate).

  - Azure Firewall supports **service tags in network rules only**, not application rules.

### 🔧 Examples of Network Rules:

**Name: Allow-DNS**

Protocol: UDP

Port: 53

Destination: \<Your DNS IP\> (e.g., Azure DNS 168.63.129.16)

**Name: Allow-NTP**

Protocol: UDP

Port: 123

Destination: time.windows.com (resolve IP or allow via tag)

**Name: Allow-AzureMonitor**

Protocol: HTTPS

Port: 443

Destination: Service Tag: AzureMonitor

**✅ Summary of What You Need:**

| **Service**        | **Rule Type**       | **Required**                       |
|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| Windows Update     | Application Rule    | FQDNs (\*.windowsupdate.com, etc.) |
| Azure Monitor      | Application Rule    | FQDNs (\*.monitor.azure.com, etc.) |
| DNS                | Network Rule        | Allow UDP/53 to your DNS server    |
| NTP                | Network Rule        | Allow UDP/123 to time servers      |
| Windows Activation | Application/Network | Optional, via FQDN or IP           |

## If Service tags available then which rules network or application?

Great point — since **Service Tags are available for both WindowsUpdate and AzureMonitor**, you might wonder if **network rules** alone are enough. Here's a clear breakdown of what to use **and why**, depending on **Azure Firewall rule types and limitations**.

**Key Difference:**

| **Rule Type** | **Supports Service Tags** | **Supports FQDNs** | **Use Case** |
|----|----|----|----|
| **Network Rules** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | When using IP ranges or **Service Tags** |
| **Application Rules** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | When needing **FQDNs** and HTTP/S only |

🔥 **Azure Firewall Application Rules do NOT support Service Tags.**\
🔥 **Service Tags can only be used in Network Rules.**

## ✅ So what should you configure?

**🔶 Use Network Rules with Service Tags for:**

- **WindowsUpdate**

- **AzureMonitor**

These are officially supported service tags in Azure and should be configured in **Network Rules**, not application rules.

## ⚙️ Recommended Network Rules

**🔧 Example:**

Rule Collection: Allow-Microsoft-Services

Rule 1:

**Name: Allow-WindowsUpdate**

Rule Type: Network

Protocol: HTTPS

Port: 443

Destination: Service Tag: WindowsUpdate

Rule 2:

**Name: Allow-AzureMonitor**

Rule Type: Network

Protocol: HTTPS

Port: 443

Destination: Service Tag: AzureMonitor

**📌 Pre-requisites for Network Rules with Service Tags:**

1.  **Azure Firewall must be deployed in the same region** as the virtual network using it.

2.  You must **explicitly allow DNS** (UDP/TCP port 53) to ensure domain resolution if your VMs rely on public endpoints.

3.  You may still need **Application Rules** if:

    - Service is not available via a service tag (e.g., custom domains).

    - You want finer control based on FQDN filtering.

**✅ Conclusion**

| **Service** | **Recommended Rule Type** | **Why** |
|----|----|----|
| Windows Update | Network Rule (with Service Tag) | Easier and future-proof |
| Azure Monitor | Network Rule (with Service Tag) | Same |
| DNS | Network Rule | For DNS resolution |
| Custom FQDNs | Application Rule | When service tag is not available |

## FQDN Tags

Great follow-up! Yes, you **can** use **FQDN Tags** in **Azure Firewall Application Rules** — and they are specifically designed for that purpose.

**✅ FQDN Tags in Application Rules – Supported**

**FQDN Tags** are a feature of **Azure Firewall Application Rules** that let you simplify rule creation for well-known Microsoft services.

⚠️ **Don't confuse FQDN Tags with Service Tags**:

- **FQDN Tags** → for **Application Rules** (FQDN-based HTTP/S filtering).

- **Service Tags** → for **Network Rules** (IP/port-based filtering).

**🔧 Example of FQDN Tag in Application Rule:**

{

"ruleCollectionName": "AppRuleCollection1",

"priority": 100,

"action": "Allow",

"rules": \[

{

"name": "AllowAzureMonitor",

"ruleType": "ApplicationRule",

"protocols": \[

{

"protocolType": "Https",

"port": 443

}

\],

"fqdnTags": \[ "AzureMonitor" \]

}

\]

}

**📌 List of Common FQDN Tags Available:**

These are just a few examples:

- WindowsUpdate

- AzureMonitor

- AzureActiveDirectory

- AppServiceEnvironment

- MicrosoftContainerRegistry

📚 **Official Microsoft Docs:**

- 🔗 [FQDN tags in Azure Firewall (Microsoft Docs)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/fqdn-tags)

**🧠 TL;DR**

| **Feature**      | **Supports Application Rules** | **Supports Network Rules** |
|------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **FQDN Tags**    | ✅ Yes                         | ❌ No                      |
| **Service Tags** | ❌ No                          | ✅ Yes                     |

So yes — **use FQDN Tags in Application Rules** when targeting known Microsoft services like Windows Update or Azure Monitor **over HTTP/HTTPS**.

Let me know if you want a sample deployment template for that!

## FQDN vs Service tags

Exactly — you’ve got it! ✅

Here's the clarified summary:

**✅ FQDN Tags → Application Rules**

- Used for **HTTP/S traffic only** (port 80/443).

- Filters based on **domains (FQDNs)**.

- Works **only in Application Rules**.

- Great for services like:

  - WindowsUpdate

  - AzureMonitor

  - AzureActiveDirectory

📘 **Docs:** [FQDN Tags in Azure Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/fqdn-tags)

**✅ Service Tags → Network Rules**

- Used for **any protocol/port** (TCP, UDP, etc.).

- Filters based on **IP ranges abstracted as tags**.

- Works **only in Network Rules**.

- Great for:

  - Allowing all Azure service IPs via tags like:

    - WindowsUpdate

    - AzureMonitor

    - Storage

    - VirtualNetwork

📘 **Docs:** [Service Tags in Azure Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/service-tags)

**📌 TL;DR:**

## DNAT Rules

**I. Summary**

The provided text offers a comprehensive overview of network firewalls, covering core principles, configuration processes, specific examples (like Azure and Git), policy considerations (web services, filtering, etc.), and deployment strategies. It emphasizes the "Principle of Least Privilege," the importance of accurate port/protocol/FQDN identification, and the need for a layered security approach.

## C. Firewall Policy

- **Core Principles:**

  - Principle of Least Privilege

  - Default Deny

  - Specificity of rules

  - No Implicit Allow

- **Rule Configuration:**

  - Whitelisting specific ports, protocols, services, and FQDNs.

  - Avoiding wildcard rules.

  - Regular review and updates.

- **Web Services Policy:**

  - Endpoint validation

  - Protocol restriction

  - Input validation

  - Rate limiting

  - IP whitelisting/blacklisting

  - Web Application Firewall (WAF)

  - Logging and monitoring

- **Filtering Policies:**

  - Web filtering policies

  - Application control policies

  - Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies

  - Zero-Trust policies

- **Basic Firewall Configuration:**

  - Blocking spoofed IPs

  - Blocking routing protocols

  - Port restrictions

  - ICMP restrictions

  - IP Masquerading

  - Zone transfer protection

  - Egress filtering

- **Advanced Firewall Features (Policy Implications):**

  - Application-Level Firewall

  - User Authentication

- **Firewall Management:**

  - Regular updates

  - Log analysis

  - Integration with other security systems

## Corrections and Clarifications

Here are some corrections and clarifications to the information:

- **FQDNs:**

  - It's crucial to emphasize that FQDN resolution (DNS) must be working correctly for FQDN-based rules to function.

  - Using FQDNs can add complexity, as IP addresses associated with a FQDN can change. Consider the dynamic nature of cloud environments.

- **Protocols:**

  - Be precise about protocols. TCP and UDP are transport layer protocols. HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, etc., are application layer protocols that use TCP or UDP.

  - For example, DNS primarily uses UDP port 53, but TCP port 53 is used for zone transfers.

- **Port Ranges:**

  - Document the *specific reason* for port ranges. Opening broad ranges increases risk. If possible, avoid ranges and use specific ports.

- **Azure PaaS:**

  - Service tags are indeed a best practice in Azure. They simplify management and automatically update when Microsoft changes the underlying IP addresses for Azure services.

- **Git Ports:**

  - Clarify that while port 9418 is used for the git:// protocol (which is insecure and rarely used), Git primarily operates over SSH (port 22) or HTTPS (port 443).

- **Web Services Policy:**

  - Emphasize the importance of API security best practices in web service firewall policies, such as input validation, output encoding, and authentication/authorization.

- **"Should be Restricted" Ports:**

  - The note that HTTP (port 80) "Should be Restricted" is a bit misleading. While HTTPS (port 443) is preferred for secure web traffic, HTTP is still used in many scenarios. The key is to have a policy that aligns with your security needs. If possible, redirect HTTP to HTTPS.

- **netstat and Task Manager:**

  - The instructions for using netstat and Task Manager are generally correct, but it's important to note that some processes might run under system accounts or other user accounts, which can make identification more challenging.

- **URL Filtering:**

  - URL filtering can be done at the firewall level or using separate proxy servers or security appliances.

- **ICMP:**

  - While allowing basic ICMP (like ping) is often useful for troubleshooting, be cautious about allowing all ICMP traffic, as some ICMP types can be used for attacks.

- **Opening Ports Securely:**

  - Emphasize the importance of regularly auditing firewall rules, removing unnecessary rules, and keeping the firewall software updated.

- **Firewall Rules:**

  - Firewall rules should be as specific as possible. Instead of opening a port for "any" source IP to "any" destination IP, specify the exact source and destination IP addresses or network ranges.

## Key Improvements and Additional Points

- **Zero Trust:** Expand on Zero Trust. It's not just a policy; it's a security model that assumes no user or device, whether inside or outside the network perimeter, can be automatically trusted. Firewall policies play a crucial role in enforcing Zero Trust principles.

- **Micro-segmentation:** Discuss micro-segmentation, which involves creating very granular security zones within the data center or cloud environment. Firewalls, especially next-generation firewalls, are essential for micro-segmentation.

- **Threat Intelligence:** Mention the importance of integrating threat intelligence feeds into firewall policies. This allows the firewall to block traffic from known malicious sources.

- **Automation:** Highlight the role of automation in firewall management. Tools and scripts can be used to automate tasks like rule creation, updates, and auditing.

- **Context Awareness:** Emphasize the need for firewalls to be context-aware. This means that the firewall can make decisions based on factors like the user's identity, the device type, and the application being used.

- **Logging and Monitoring:**

  - Firewall logs are critical for security monitoring, incident response, and auditing.

  - Implement robust logging and monitoring solutions.

  - Use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to analyze firewall logs and detect security threats.

By incorporating these corrections, clarifications, and additional points, you can create a more accurate, comprehensive, and valuable resource on network firewalls.

# Proxy feature in Azure Firewall

The **explicit proxy** feature on a firewall refers to a configuration where **client devices are explicitly told to forward their web traffic to a proxy server (in this case, the firewall itself)** for processing, rather than sending it directly to the internet.

**What is a proxy?**

A **proxy** sits between a client (like a web browser) and the internet. It receives client requests, processes them, and forwards them to the destination. It can inspect, filter, cache, and log the traffic.

**Explicit Proxy means:**

- The **client knows about the proxy** and is configured to send traffic to it.

- Commonly used in **web proxy (HTTP/HTTPS) scenarios**.

- You **manually configure** browser settings (or use a PAC file / GPO / WPAD) to route traffic to the firewall proxy.

**Benefits:**

- **Better visibility and control** over user internet activity.

- Can enforce **URL filtering, malware scanning**, SSL inspection, etc.

- Can apply **user- or group-based policies** if integrated with authentication.

- Useful in **BYOD or guest networks** where you want to control traffic without deploying agents.

**Contrast with Transparent Proxy:**

| **Feature** | **Explicit Proxy** | **Transparent Proxy** |
|----|----|----|
| Client Configuration | Required | Not required |
| Application Awareness | Client knows it's a proxy | Client thinks it talks to destination |
| Flexibility | More granular control | Easier to deploy |

The **Azure Firewall Explicit Proxy** feature allows you to configure **Azure Firewall** as an explicit web proxy for outbound internet traffic. This means that instead of relying on transparent (implicit) routing, client devices or applications are explicitly configured to send their web (HTTP/HTTPS) traffic to Azure Firewall for inspection and filtering.

**🔍 What is Explicit Proxy?**

An **explicit proxy** requires the client (e.g., browser or system) to be configured to use a specific proxy server (in this case, Azure Firewall). This is different from a **transparent proxy**, where the traffic is redirected to the proxy without the client knowing.

**💡 Key Features of Azure Firewall Explicit Proxy**

1.  **Proxy-aware routing**:

    - Clients (e.g., browsers, OS settings, PAC files) are configured to send their internet-bound HTTP/S traffic directly to the Azure Firewall IP.

2.  **Full URL inspection**:

    - Supports URL-based rules for both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

    - Enables fine-grained access control policies (e.g., block social media, allow only specific sites).

3.  **Authentication support**:

    - Can integrate with **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** for user-based policies using Azure Firewall Premium and Identity-based rules.

4.  **TLS Termination and Inspection**:

    - With Azure Firewall Premium, HTTPS traffic can be decrypted, inspected, and re-encrypted.

5.  **Logging and monitoring**:

    - All traffic going through the proxy is logged via Azure Monitor and can be exported to Log Analytics, Event Hubs, or Storage accounts.

6.  **Simplified routing**:

    - No need for UDRs or redirect rules when clients are configured with proxy settings.

**📦 How to Configure It**

1.  **Enable Explicit Proxy Mode**:

    - In the Azure Firewall configuration, enable the **Explicit Proxy** setting.

2.  **Configure Clients**:

    - Use **Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) files**, Group Policy, or manual settings to point clients to the Azure Firewall private IP on port **3128** (default for explicit proxy).

3.  **Define Application Rules**:

    - Set up rules in the firewall to control access based on URLs, categories (Premium), and user identity (optional).

**✅ When to Use It**

- You want **fine-grained web filtering** without relying solely on network-level rules.

- You need **per-user internet access control** using Azure AD.

- You want centralized control and monitoring for internet-bound traffic from clients in Azure or hybrid environments.

**📝 Example Use Case**

Imagine a scenario where you have Windows 11 devices in Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD), and you want to:

- Allow only specific websites (e.g., company domains)

- Block social media

- Monitor user activity

- Apply different rules based on user identity

With Azure Firewall Explicit Proxy, you can do all of this efficiently.

# How to bypass Firewall?

Provide example of how firewall can be bypassed by an outsider to access the corporate network.

Firewalls are a critical security measure and bypassing them can leave a network vulnerable to attacks.

However, I can summarize some common methods attackers use to try to bypass firewalls:

**Exploiting Weaknesses:**

- **Misconfigurations:** Attackers can exploit mistakes in firewall settings to send data packets that bypass security rules.

- **Open Ports:** If unnecessary ports are open on the firewall, attackers can use them to send malicious traffic.

**Tricking Users:**

- **Social Engineering:** Attackers may manipulate people (e.g., through phishing emails) to click malicious links or download malware that can bypass security measures.

**Alternative Routes:**

- **VPNs:** Attackers might misuse VPNs designed for legitimate remote access to bypass restrictions.

- **Proxy Servers:** Proxy servers can be used to mask a user's location and potentially bypass firewall rules.

It is important to remember that these are just some examples, and new techniques are constantly emerging. Here are some security practices to counter these methods:

- **Strong Firewall Rules:** Regularly review and update firewall rules to close any gaps in security.

- **User Education:** Train employees to identify and avoid social engineering tactics.

- **Multi-Layered Security:** Use a combination of security measures, including firewalls, intrusion detection, and data encryption, to create a strong defense.

- **Patching Systems:** Keep all software and systems updated with the latest security patches.

# Incident Response

How can a firewall be used to detect and prevent unauthorized access to a network? What types of logs and alerts should be monitored?

What is worse in firewall detection, a false negative or a false positive? And why? Consider a scenario where a firewall is protecting an online banking system. Which would be more detrimental: a false negative that allows a malicious attack to bypass the firewall or a false positive that blocks legitimate customer transactions? Explain your reasoning.

# The End
