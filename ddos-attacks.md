# DDoS Protection

How Azure DDoS protection works?

DDoS Protection Standard monitors actual traffic utilization and
constantly compares it against the thresholds defined in the DDoS
policy. When the traffic threshold is exceeded, DDoS mitigation is
automatically initiated. When traffic returns to a level below the
threshold, the mitigation is removed. During mitigation, DDoS Protection
redirects traffic sent to the protected resource and performs several
checks, including:

- Helping ensure that packets conform to internet specifications and are
  not malformed.

- Interacting with the client to determine if the traffic might be a
  spoofed packet (for example, using SYN Auth or SYN Cookie or dropping
  a packet for the source to retransmit it).

- Using rate-limit packets if it cannot perform any other enforcement
  method.

Within a few minutes of attack detection, you will be notified with
Azure Monitor metrics. Azure Monitor retains metric data for DDoS
Protection Standard for 30 days.

Types of DDoS attacks that Azure DDoS protection mitigates

- **Volumetric attacks:** UDP floods, amplification floods, and other
  spoofed-packet floods (Multiple GB attacks)

- **Protocol attacks**: SYN flood attacks, reflection attacks, and other
  protocol attacks

- **Resource (Application) layer attacks**: HTTP protocol violations,
  SQL injection, cross-site scripting and other layer 7 attacks

## DDoS Attack

- Attack that has the goal of preventing access to services or systems
  (Availability).

- If attack launched from one location, then it is called Denial of
  Service attack.

- If attack launched from multiple locations the it is called
  Distributed DoS attack.

- Botnets are collection of interconnected systems and used without
  owner knowledge.

- Botnet owners use them for Spamming, DDoS, Data storage and various
  other actions.

 

## Best practices

Secure application development

- **Scalability** - Ability of a system to handle increased load

- **Availability** - Proportion of time that a system is functional and
  working

- **Resiliency** - Ability of a system to recover from failures and
  continue to function

- **Management** - Operations processes that keep a system running in
  production

- **Security** - Protecting applications and data from threats

Design application to scale horizontally

- If your application depends on a single instance of a service, it
  creates a single point of failure.

- Provisioning multiple instances makes your system more resilient and
  more scalable.

Design layers of security defenses in application

- Reduce the surface area by using IP allowlists to close the exposed IP
  address space and listening ports that are not needed on the load
  balancers.

- ‎You can also use NSGs (Service tag, ASG) to reduce the attack surface.

# DDoS Attack

Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks
are malicious attempts to disrupt the normal traffic of a network by
overwhelming it with fake requests. This makes the network or service
unavailable to legitimate users.

DoS attack originates from a single source, while DDoS attack comes from
multiple sources, typically botnets which are collections of compromised
devices.

The goal of both attacks is to overload the target system's resources
and prevent it from functioning properly. DDoS attacks are more
difficult to defend against because they are spread out across many
devices.

DoS and DDoS attacks can be used to distract security personnel while
other attacks are carried out.

DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks overwhelm a network with
fake traffic from multiple sources, making it unavailable to legitimate
users.

Here is how to prevent them:

- **Plan:** Create a response plan outlining steps to take during a DDoS
  attack.

- **Security:** Implement basic network security measures like
  firewalls.

- **Architecture:** Design a strong network architecture that can handle
  traffic spikes.

- **Warning Signs:** Be aware of signs that might indicate a DDoS
  attack.

- **DDoS Protection Services:** Consider using services that can
  mitigate DDoS attacks.

  continue to function

- <u>Management</u> - Operations processes that keep a system running in
  production

- <u>Security</u> - Protecting applications and data from threats

**Design application to scale horizontally**

- If your application depends on a single instance of a service, it
  creates a single point of failure.

- Provisioning multiple instances makes your system more resilient and
  more scalable.

**Design layers of security defenses in application**

3.  Reduce the surface area by using IP allowlists to close down the
    exposed IP address space and listening ports that aren’t needed on
    the load balancers.

4.  ‎You can also use NSGs (Service tag, ASG) to reduce the attack
    surface.

## Detection and Mitigation Techniques

This summarizes various techniques to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks:

**Activity Profiling:**

- Monitors network traffic patterns and identifies deviations from the
  norm.

- Analyzes average packet rates for network flows (groups of packets
  with similar characteristics) based on header information.

- An increase in activity levels or the number of distinct clusters can
  indicate a DDoS attack.

**Detection Techniques:**

- These techniques aim to differentiate legitimate traffic from
  malicious attack traffic.

- They identify abnormal increases in traffic volume or "flash events"
  (sudden spikes) compared to established baselines.

- Common techniques include:

  - **Activity Profiling (described above)**

  - **Wavelet-based Signal Analysis:** Analyzes traffic data in terms of
    frequency components to detect anomalies.

  - **Changepoint Detection:**

    - Isolates traffic changes caused by attacks using statistical
      algorithms.

    - Filters traffic data and identifies attack points using techniques
      like Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) to detect deviations from expected
      traffic patterns.

    - Can also identify scanning activities of worms.

**Protecting Secondary Victims:**

These measures aim to minimize the impact of DDoS attacks on secondary
victims (internet users and connected devices):

- **Software Updates:** Install and update anti-malware software on all
  devices.

- **Security Awareness:** Educate users about security issues and
  prevention techniques.

- **Application Management:** Disable unnecessary services, uninstall
  unused applications, and scan external files before opening them.

- **System Hardening:** Configure and update security settings on
  devices (firewalls, operating systems, applications).

- **Additional Measures:** Implement strong encryption, conduct
  vulnerability scans, use robust input validation, and secure remote
  access protocols.

**Remember:**

A combination of these techniques can significantly enhance your DDoS
defense strategy. By proactively monitoring traffic patterns and
implementing security measures, you can minimize the risk and impact of
DDoS attacks on your network and protect secondary victims.

# Method of DDoS attacks

DDoS attacks use botnets, which are groups of hacked devices controlled
by attackers, to overwhelm a target system with traffic from multiple
sources. There are different techniques to launch DDoS attacks:

- **Botnet Flood:** A large number of compromised devices bombard the
  target with traffic, overloading its resources.

- **Smurf Attack:** Spoofed IP addresses are used to send messages to a
  victim's IP address, causing the network to get flooded with
  responses.

- **TCP SYN Flood Attack:** Attackers send a massive amount of
  connection requests to the target system, leaving it stuck waiting for
  responses and unable to handle legitimate traffic.

- **Teardrop Attack:** Malformed packets are sent to the target, causing
  it to crash or malfunction.

- **Ping of Death Attack:** Oversized packets are sent to the target,
  crashing or freezing it.

These last two methods are less common as system vulnerabilities they
exploit have been patched.

  botnets.

- DDoS attacks can be used as distractions for other cyber attacks.

 

## 3-Way Handshake and Denial-of-Service Attacks

The three-way handshake is a fundamental process in establishing
reliable connections using the TCP protocol. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **SYN (Synchronize):** The client sends a packet with a
    synchronization flag to initiate a connection with the server.

2.  **SYN/ACK (Synchronize Acknowledge):** The server responds with a
    packet containing both SYN and ACK flags, acknowledging the client's
    request and indicating its readiness to connect.

3.  **ACK (Acknowledge):** Finally, the client sends an ACK packet
    confirming its receipt of the server's response, and the connection
    is established.

**Exploiting the Handshake for DoS Attacks:**

Attackers can exploit the three-way handshake to launch a
Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack known as a SYN flood attack. Here's how
it works:

1.  **Fake SYN Packets:** The attacker sends a large number of SYN
    packets to the target server, often with spoofed IP addresses.

2.  **Server Response:** The server, unaware of the attack, responds to
    each SYN packet with a SYN/ACK packet, allocating resources for a
    potential connection.

3.  **Missing ACK:** The attacker never sends the final ACK packet,
    leaving the server waiting for completion of the handshake for each
    connection.

4.  **Resource Exhaustion:** With a continuous stream of fake SYN
    packets, the server becomes overwhelmed, depleting resources
    (memory, processing power) to handle incomplete connections. This
    prevents the server from responding to legitimate connection
    requests, effectively denying service to real users.

**Key Points:**

- The DoS attack leverages the server's expectation of a complete
  handshake and its resource allocation for pending connections.

- By overwhelming the server with incomplete connections, the attacker
  cripples its ability to serve legitimate users.

**Mitigating SYN Flood Attacks:**

- **SYN Cookies:** Techniques like SYN cookies allow servers to
  acknowledge SYN requests without consuming as many resources.

- **Rate Limiting:** Limiting the number of incoming connections per IP
  address can help prevent attackers from overwhelming the server.

- **Resource Monitoring:** Continuously monitoring server resources and
  implementing automated actions can help detect and respond to DoS
  attacks.

# DDoS Tools 

This summary outlines various tools used to launch DDoS attacks.

**DDoS Attack Tools:**

- **Pandora DDoS Bot Toolkit:** Offers five attack modes including HTTP
  floods and connection floods.

DDoS attacks. By combining it with secure application development and
best practices, you can significantly enhance your cloud environment's
resilience.

# DDoS IR

## Preparation

**DDoS IR Preparation is Key:**

- **Objective:** Establish contacts, define procedures, and gather
  information to expedite response during an attack.

**Key Actions:**

- **ISP Support:**

  - Understand your ISP's DDoS mitigation options (free/paid) and
    reporting procedures.

  - Consider redundant internet connections.

  - Establish contact with ISP and law enforcement (out-of-band
    communication channels like phone calls).

- **Inventory:**

  - Create a whitelist of critical IP addresses and protocols
    (customers, partners) for traffic prioritization.

  - Document IT infrastructure details (owners, IP addresses, circuits,
    routing, network topology).

- **Network Infrastructure:**

  - Design a resilient network with no single points of failure
    (bottlenecks).

  - Distribute critical services (DNS, SMTP) across different Autonomous
    Systems (AS).

  - Harden network, OS, and application configurations against DDoS
    attacks.

  - Baseline network performance for faster attack detection.

  - Consider specialized DDoS mitigation services for internet-dependent
    businesses.

  - Lower DNS Time-To-Live (TTL) for faster redirection during attacks
    (600 seconds is a good value).

  - Implement backups to switch to in case of service disruption.

- **Internal Contacts:**

  - Establish contact points for IDS, firewall, systems, and network
    teams.

  - Collaborate with business units to understand potential financial
    losses from DDoS attacks.

  - Involve Business Continuity Plan/Disaster Recovery (BCP/DR) teams in
    DDoS incident response.

## Detection and Analysis

**Objective:** Detect the attack, determine its scope, and involve
relevant teams.

**Analysis Steps:**

1.  **Understand the Attack:**

    - Analyze attack flow and identify affected infrastructure
      components.

    - Determine if you are the target or a collateral victim.

2.  **Review Logs and Files:**

    - Check load and log files of servers, routers, firewalls,
      applications, etc.

    - Identify suspicious traffic patterns compared to normal traffic
      (source IPs, ports, protocols).

3.  **Network Traffic Analysis:**

    - Use tools like Tcpdump, Snort, and Ntop to analyse network
      traffic.

  attack has subsided.

## Protecting Secondary Victims from DDoS Attacks

DDoS attacks can have a ripple effect, impacting not just the targeted
system but also secondary victims like internet users and connected
devices. Here is a breakdown of how to safeguard secondary victims:

**Defensive Measures:**

- **Software Updates:** Implement strong anti-virus and anti-trojan
  software on all connected devices. Regularly update these programs to
  ensure they can identify and block the latest threats.

- **Security Awareness:** Raise awareness among users about DDoS attacks
  and prevention techniques. Educate them on recognizing suspicious
  activity and avoiding potential attack vectors (e.g., downloading
  attachments from unknown sources).

- **Application Management:** Disable unnecessary services and uninstall
  unused applications to reduce attack surface area. Scan all external
  files before opening them to prevent malware infection.

- **System Hardening:** Configure and update security settings on all
  devices. This includes firewalls, operating systems, and application
  configurations. Ensure these systems are patched with the latest
  security updates.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Encryption:** Utilize strong encryption protocols like WPA2 and AES
  256 to protect data transmissions from eavesdropping and manipulation.

- **Vulnerability Scans:** Regularly scan systems for vulnerabilities
  and patch them promptly to minimize the risk of exploitation by DDoS
  attackers.

- **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation techniques to
  prevent malicious code injection attempts and improve system security.

- **Secure Remote Access:** Secure remote administration and
  connectivity testing protocols to prevent unauthorized access that
  could be used in DDoS attacks.

**Remember:**

By employing these defensive measures and promoting security awareness
among users, secondary victims can significantly reduce their risk of
being impacted by DDoS attacks.

Following a DDoS attack, forensic analysis is crucial to improve your
defenses and prevent future incidents. Here's what you should do:

**Analyze Attack Data:**

- **Traffic Patterns:** Identify unique characteristics of the attack
  traffic to develop filtering techniques that can block similar attacks
  in the future.

- **Log Analysis:** Analyze logs from routers, firewalls, and intrusion
  detection systems (IDS) to pinpoint the source of the attack and
  identify compromised systems within your network. Trace back attacker
  IPs with the help of ISPs and law enforcement if necessary.

**Improve Countermeasures:**

- **Filtering Techniques:** Use the insights from traffic pattern
  analysis to refine your filtering techniques for load balancing and
  throttling mechanisms. This helps differentiate legitimate traffic
  from malicious traffic.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Collaboration:** Work with your ISP to understand their DDoS
  mitigation capabilities and explore additional protection options.

- **Documentation:** Document the entire incident, including the attack
  timeline, scope, impact, and lessons learned. This information is
  valuable for future preparedness and training purposes.

# DDoS attack

## Concepts

DoS stands for Denial of Service

DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service

DDoS is a malicious attempt of disrupting regular traffic of network by
flooding with a large number of fake requests and making server
unavailable to the appropriate requests. These fake requests come from
several unauthorized sources and hence called distributed denial of
service attack.

Objective of a DoS attack is to overwhelm the resources of a target
system and cause it to stop functioning, denying access to its users.
DDoS is a variant of DoS in which attackers compromise a large number of
computers or other devices, and use them in a coordinated attack against
the target system.

DDoS attack is generally done by this sometimes happens due to a client
misconfiguration.

DDoS attacks are often used in combination with other cyber threats.

These attacks may launch DoS attack to capture the attention of security
staff and create confusion, while they carry out more subtle attacks
aimed at stealing data or causing other damage.

DoS is an attack on a computer or network that reduces, restricts or
prevents accessibility of system resources to its legitimate users. In a
DoS attack, attackers flood a victim system with non-legitimate service
requests or traffic to overload its resources. DoS attack leads to
unavailability of a particular website and show network performance.

DDoS attack involves a multitude of compromised systems attacking a
single target, thereby causing denial of service for users of the
targeted system. To launch a DDoS attack, an attacker uses botnets and
attacks a single system.

## DDoS Attack Methods

### Botnets 

Systems under hacker control that have been infected with malware.
Attackers use these bots to carry out DDoS attacks. Large botnets can
include millions of devices and can launch attacks at devastating scale.

During a DDoS attack, the botnet sends an overwhelming number of
requests to a targeted server or application, causing it to crash.

Bots are software applications that run automated tasks over the
Internet and perform simple repetitive tasks, such as web spidering and
search engine indexing. A botnet is a huge network of the compromised
systems and can be used by an attacker to launch denial-of-service
attacks.

 

**Scanning Methods for Finding Vulnerable Machines**

- **Random Scanning**: The infected machine probes IP addresses randomly
  from target network IP range and checks for the vulnerability.

- **Hit-list Scanning**: Attacker first collects a list of possible
  potentially vulnerable machines and then performs scanning to find
  vulnerable machines.

- **Topological Scanning**: It uses the information obtained on infected
  machines to find new vulnerable machines.

- **Local Subnet Scanning**: The infected machine looks for the new
  vulnerable machine in its own local network.

- **Permutation Scanning**: It uses a pseudorandom permutation list of
  IP addresses to find new vulnerable machines. Divide and conquer

 

**How Malicious Code Propagates?**

Attackers use three techniques to propagate malicious code to newly
discovered vulnerable system:

- **Central Source Propagation**: Attacker places attack toolkit on the
  central source and copy of the attack toolkit is transferred to newly
  discovered vulnerable system.

- **Back-chaining Propagation**: Attacker places attack toolkit on
  his/her system itself and copy of the attack toolkit is transferred to
  newly discovered vulnerable system.

- **Autonomous Propagation**: Attack toolkit is transferred at the time
  when the new vulnerable system is discovered.

**<span class="mark">Botnet Trojan-Blackshades NET</span>**

Blackshades NET has the ability to create implant binaries which employ
custom obfuscation algorithms or Crypters, which can be bought through
the Bot/Crypter marketplace embedded in the Blackshades controller.
Another botnet: Cythosia Botnet, Andromeda Bot, Mirai botnet

**<span class="mark">Botnet Trojan-PlugBot</span>**

PlugBot is a hardware botnet project. It is a covert PenTest Device
(Bot) designed for covert use during physical PenTest.

### Smurf attack 

Sends Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo requests to the
victim’s IP address. The ICMP requests are generated from ‘spoofed’ IP
addresses. Attackers automate this process and perform it at scale to
overwhelm a target system.

### TCP State-Exhaustion Attacks

Consumes the connection state tables present in the network
infrastructure components such as load-balancers, firewalls, and
application servers.

### TCP SYN Flood attack

Attacks flood the target system with connection requests. When the
target system attempts to complete the connection, the attacker’s device
does not respond, forcing the target system to time out. This quickly
fills the connection queue, preventing legitimate users from connecting.

- The attacker sends many SYN requests to the target server (victim)
  with fake source IP addresses.

- The target machine sends back a SYN/ACK in response to the request and
  waits for the ACK to complete the session setup. The target machine
  does not get the response because the source address is fake.

<!-- -->

- SYN Flooding takes advantage of a flaw in how most hosts implement the
  TCP three-way handshake.

- When Host B receives the SYN request from A, it must keep track of the
  partially opened connection in a "listen queue" for at least 75
  seconds.

- A malicious host can exploit the small size of the listen queue by
  sending multiple SYN requests to a host, but never replying to the
  SYN/ACK.

- The victim's listening queue is quickly filled up.

- The ability of holding up each incomplete connection for 75 seconds
  can be cumulatively used as a Denial-of-Service attack.

**Three-way handshake**

- TCP SYN request

- SYN/ACK

- ACK response

### Teardrop attack 

Teardrop attack causes the length and fragmentation offset fields in IP
packets to overlap. The targeted system tries to reconstruct packets but
fails, which can cause it to crash.

### Ping of death attack 

Pings a target system using malformed or oversized IP packets, causing
the target system to crash or freeze.

### Network Layer DDoS Attacks

SYN Floods

UDP Floods

DNS Amplification

Techniques designed to eat up the target’s bandwidth.

### Application-Layer Flood Attacks 

- Application-level flood attacks result in the loss of services of a
  particular network, such as emails, network resources, the temporary
  ceasing of applications and services, and more.

- Using this attack, attackers exploit weaknesses in programming source
  code to prevent the application from processing legitimate requests.

- Using application-level flood attacks, attackers attempt to:

  - Flood web applications to legitimate user traffic.

  - Disrupt service to specific System/Person, for example blocking a
    user's access by repeating invalid login attempts.

  - Jam the application-database connection by crafting malicious SQL
    queries.

Consumes the application resources or service thereby making it
unavailable to other legitimate users.

HTTP Floods

Slowloris or RUDY Attacks

Zero-day Attacks

Attacks that target vulnerabilities in OS, Apps, Protocols to crash a
particular application.

### Volumetric Attacks 

Consumes the bandwidth of target network or service.

### Fragmentation Attacks

Overwhelms target's ability of re-assembling the fragmented packets.

### Bandwidth Attacks 

- A single machine cannot make enough requests to overwhelm network
  equipment; hence DDoS attacks were created where an attacker uses
  several computers to flood a victim.

- When a DDoS attack is launched, flooding a network, it can cause
  network equipment such as switches and routers to be overwhelmed due
  to the significant statistical change in the network traffic.

- Attackers use botnets and carry out DDoS attacks by flooding the
  network with ICMP ECHO packets.

- Basically, all bandwidth is used and no bandwidth remains for
  legitimate use.

 

### Service Request Floods 

- An attacker or group of zombies attempts to exhaust server resources
  by setting up and tearing down TCP connections.

- Service request flood attacks flood servers with a high rate of
  connections from a valid source.

- It initiates a request on every connection.

 

### ICMP Flood Attack 

- ICMP flood attack is a type DoS attack in which perpetrators send a
  large number of ICMP packets directly or through reflection networks
  to victims causing it to be overwhelmed and subsequently stop
  responding to legitimate TCP/IP requests.

- To protect against ICMP flood attack, set a threshold limit that when
  exceeded invokes the ICMP flood attack protection feature.

 

### Peer-to-Peer Attacks 

- Using peer-to-peer attacks, attackers instruct clients of peer-to-peer
  file sharing hubs to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and to
  connect to the victim's fake website.

- Attackers exploit flaws found in the network using DC++ (Direct
  Connect) protocol, that is used for sharing all types of files between
  instant messaging clients.

- Using this method, attackers launch massive denial-of-service attacks
  and compromise websites.

- DC++ (Direct Connect) protocol -the attacker acts as a "puppet
  master," instructing clients of large peer-to-peer file sharing hubs
  to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and to connect to the
  victim's website instead.

 

### Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) Attack 

- **Phlashing**: Permanent DoS, also known as Phlashing, refers to
  attacks that cause irreversible damage to system hardware.

- **Sabotage**: Unlike other DoS attacks, it sabotages the system
  hardware, requiring the victim to replace or reinstall the hardware.

- **Bricking a system**: This attack is carried out using a method known
  as "bricking a system" in this attacker send fraudulent hardware
  updates to the victims.

 

 

### Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DrDOS) 

- A distributed reflected denial of service attack (DRDoS), also known
  as spoofed attack, involves the use of multiple intermediate and
  secondary machines that contribute to the actual DDoS attack against
  the target machine or application.

- Attacker launches this attack by sending requests to the intermediary
  hosts, these requests are then redirected to the secondary machines
  which in turn reflects the attack traffic to the target.

- In this attack the primary target seems to be directly attacked by the
  secondary victim, not the actual attacker.

- IN this attack as multiple intermediary victim servers are used which
  results in an increase in attack bandwidth.

 

## DDoS Tools 

### Pandora DDoS Bot Toolkit 

The Pandora DDoS Bot Toolkit is an updated variant of the Dirt Jumper
DDoS toolkit. It offers five distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack
modes. It generates five attack types:

- HTTP min

- HTTP download

- HTTP Combo

- Socket Connect

- Max Flood

### Dereil and HOIC 

Dereil: Dereil is professional (DDoS) Tools with modern patterns for
attack via TCP, UDP, and HTTP protocols.

HOIC: HOIC makes DDoS attacks to any IP address, with a user selected
port and a user selected protocol.

### DoS HTTP and BanglaDos 

DoS HTTP: DoSHTTP is HTTP Flood Denial of Service (DoS) Testing Tool for
Windows. It includes URL verification, HTTP redirection, port
designation, performance monitoring and enhanced reporting. It uses
multiple asynchronous sockets to perform an effective HTTP Flood.

BanglaDos:

### AnDOSid for Mobile

AnDOSid allows attackers to simulate a DOS attack (A http post flood
attack to be exact) and DDoS attack on a web server from mobile phones.

## DDoS IR: Preparation

The “preparation” phase is to be considered as the most important
element of a successful DDoS incident response.

### Objective of Preparation

Establish contacts, define procedures, and gather information to save
time during an attack.

### ISP Support

- Contact your ISP to understand the DDoS mitigation services it offers
  (free and paid) and what process you should follow.

- If possible, subscribe to a redundant Internet connection.

- Establish contacts with your ISP and law enforcement entities. Make
  sure that you have the possibility to use an out-of-band communication
  channel (e.g.: phone).

### Inventory

- Create a whitelist of the IP addresses and protocols you must allow if
  prioritizing traffic during an attack. Don’t forget to include your
  critical customers, key partners, etc.

- Document your IT infrastructure details, including business owners, IP
  addresses and circuit IDs, routing settings (AS, etc); prepare a
  network topology diagram and an asset inventory.

### Network infrastructure

- Design a good network infrastructure without Single Point of Failure
  or bottleneck.

- Distribute your DNS servers and other critical services (SMTP, etc)
  through different AS.

- Harden the configuration of network, OS, and application components
  that may be targeted by DDoS.

- Baseline your current infrastructure’s performance, so you can
  identify the attack faster and more accurately.

- If your business is Internet dependent, consider purchasing
  specialized DDoS mitigation products or services.

- Confirm DNS time-to-live (TTL) settings for the systems that might be
  attacked. Lower the TTLs, if necessary, to facilitate DNS redirection
  if the original IP addresses get attacked. 600 is a good TTL value.

- Depending of the criticality of your services, consider setting- up a
  backup that you can switch on in case of issue.

### Internal contacts

- Establish contacts for your IDS, firewall, systems, and network teams.

- Collaborate with the business lines to understand business
  implications (e.g., money loss) of likely DDoS attack scenarios.

- Involve your BCP/DR planning team on DDoS incidents.

## DDoS IR: Detection and Analysis

### Objective of detection and analysis

Detect the incident, determine its scope, and involve the appropriate
parties.

### Analyze the attack: 

- Understand the logical flow of the DDoS attack and identify the
  infrastructure components affected by it.

- Understand if you are the target of the attack or a collateral victim

- Review the load and log files of servers, routers, firewalls,
  applications, and other affected infrastructure.

- Identify what aspects of the DDoS traffic differentiate it from benign
  traffic

  - Source IP addresses, AS, etc

  - Destination ports

  - URLs

  - Protocols flags

- Network analysis tools can be used to review the traffic: Tcpdump,
  Snort, Ntop

- If possible, create a NIDS signature to focus to differentiate between
  benign and malicious traffic.

### Involve internal and external actors

- Contact your internal teams to learn about their visibility into the
  attack.

- Contact your ISP to ask for help. Be specific about the traffic you
  would like to control:

  - Network blocks involved

  - Source IP addresses

  - Protocols

- Notify your company’s executive and legal teams.

### Check the background

- Find out whether the company received an extortion demand as a
  precursor to the attack.

- Search if anyone would have any interest into threatening your company

  - Competitors

  - Ideologically-motivated groups (hacktivists)

  - Former employees

 

### DDoS Detection

Detection techniques are based on identifying and discriminating the
illegitimate traffic increase and flash events from legitimate packet
traffic. All detection techniques define an attack as an abnormal and
noticeable deviation from a threshold of normal network traffic
statistics.

### Activity Profiling 

An attack is indicated by: An increase in activity levels among the
network flow clusters. An increase in the overall number of distinct
clusters (DDoS attack). Activity profile is done based on the average
packet rate for a network flow, which consists of consecutive packets
with similar packet fields. Activity profile is obtained by monitoring
the network packet's header information. Activity Profiling monitors a
network packet's header information, calculates the average packet rate
for a network flow.

### Wavelet-based Signal Analysis 

Wavelet analysis describes an input signal in terms of spectral
components. Wavelets provide for concurrent time and frequency
description. Analysing each spectral window's energy determines the
presence of anomalies. Signal analysis determines the time at which
certain frequency components are present.

### Isolate Traffic

Change-point detection algorithms isolate changes in network traffic
statistics caused by attacks.

### Filter Traffic 

The algorithms filter the target traffic data by address, port, or
protocol and store the resultant flow as a time series.

### Identify Attack 

Sequential change-point detection technique uses Cumulative Sum (Cusum)
algorithm to identify and locate the DoS attacks; the algorithm
calculates deviations in the actual versus expected local average in the
traffic time series.

### Identify Scan Activity 

This technique can also be used to identify the typical scanning
activities of the network worms.

### Egress Filtering 

Scanning packet headers of IP packets leaving a network. Egress
filtering ensures that unauthorized or malicious traffic never leaves
internal network.

### Ingress Filtering 

Protects from flooding attacks which originate from the valid prefixes
(IP address). It enables the originator to be traced to its true source.

### TCP Intercept 

Configuring TCP Intercept prevents DoS attacks by intercepting and
validating the TCP connection requests.

## DDoS IR: Containment

### Objective of Containment 

Mitigate the attack’s effects on the targeted environment.

- If the bottleneck is a particular feature of an application,
  temporarily disable that feature.

- Attempt to throttle or block DDoS traffic as close to the network’s
  “cloud” as possible via a router, firewall, load balancer, specialized
  device, etc.

- Terminate unwanted connections or processes on servers and routers and
  tune their TCP/IP settings.

- If possible, switch to alternate sites or networks using DNS or
  another mechanism. Blackhole DDoS traffic targeting the original IP
  addresses.

- Set up an alternate communication channel between you and your
  users/customers (e.g.: web/mail/voice server, etc.)

- If possible, route traffic through a traffic-scrubbing service or
  product via DNS or routing changes (e.g.: sinkhole routing)

- Configure egress filters to block the traffic your systems may send in
  response to DDoS traffic (e.g.: back squatter traffic), to avoid
  adding unnecessary packets to the network.

- In case of an extortion attempt, try to buy time with the fraudster.
  For example, explain that you need more time in order to get
  management approval.

- If the bottleneck is at the ISP’s side, only the ISP can take
  efficient actions. In that case, work closely with your ISP and make
  sure you share information efficiently.

>  

## DDoS IR: Remediation

### Objective of Remediation

Take actions to stop the Denial-of-Service condition.

Contact your ISP and make sure that it enforces remediation measures.
For information, here are some of the possible measures:

- Filtering (if possible, at level Tier1 or 2)

- Traffic-scrubbing/Sinkhole/Clean-pipe

- Blackhole Routing

If the DDoS sponsors have been identified, consider involving law
enforcement. This should be performed upon the direction of your
company’s executive and legal teams. Technical remediation actions can
mostly be enforced by your ISP.

>  

## DDoS IR: Recovery

### Objective of Recovery

Come back to the previous functional state.

Assess the end of the DDoS condition

- Ensure that the impacted services are reachable again.

- Ensure that your infrastructure performance is back to your baseline
  performance.

- Rollback the mitigation measures

- Switch back traffic to your original network.

- Restart stopped services.

Ensure that the recovery-related actions are decided in accordance with
the network teams. Bringing up services could have unexpected side
effects.

## DDoS IR: Post Incident Activity

### Objective of Post Incident Activity

Document the incident’s details, discuss lessons learned, and adjust
plans and defenses.

- Consider what preparation steps you could have taken to respond to the
  incident faster or more effectively.

- If necessary, adjust assumptions that affected the decisions made
  during DDoS incident preparation.

- Assess the effectiveness of your DDoS response process, involving
  people and communications.

- Consider what relationships inside and outside your organizations
  could help you with future incidents.

- Collaborate with legal teams if a legal action is in process

### DDoS Prevention

Build DDoS response plan

Employ basic network security

Maintain strong network architecture

Understand the Warning Signs

Consider DDoS as a service

### Absorbing the Attack

Use additional capacity to absorb attack; it requires preplanning. It
requires additional resources.

### Degrading Services

Identify critical services and stop non critical services.

### Shutting Down the Services

Shut down all the services until the attack has subsided.

### Protect Secondary Victims 

- Install anti-virus and anti-Trojan software and keep these up-to-date.

- Increase awareness of security issues and prevention techniques in all
  Internet users.

- Disable unnecessary services, uninstall unused applications, and scan
  all the files received from external sources.

- Properly configure and regularly update the built-in defensive
  mechanisms in the core hardware and software of the system.

### Detect and Neutralize Handlers 

- Network Traffic Analysis: Analyse communication protocols and traffic
  patterns between handlers and clients or handlers and agents in order
  to identify the network nodes that might be infected by the handlers.

- Neutralize Botnet Handlers: There are usually few DDoS handlers
  deployed as compared to the number of agents. Neutralizing a few
  handlers can possibly render multiple agents useless, thus thwarting
  DDoS attacks.

- Spoofed Source Address: There is a decent probability that the spoofed
  source address of DDoS attack packets will not represent a valid
  source address of the definite sub-network.

### Deflect Attacks 

- **Use Honeypots**: Systems that are set up with limited security. Act
  as an enticement for an attacker. Honeypots serve as a means for
  gaining information about attackers, attack techniques and tools by
  storing a record of the system activities.

- **Use Defense-in-depth** with IDSes at different network points to
  divert suspicious DoS traffic to several honeypots.

- **Low-interaction honeypots** all services offered by a Low
  Interaction Honeypots are emulated.

- **High-interaction honeypots** make use of the actual vulnerable
  service or software.

- **KFSensor**: KFSensor is a Windows-based honeypot IDS.

### Mitigate Attacks 

- **Load Balancing**: Increase bandwidth on critical connections to
  absorb additional traffic generated by an attack. Replicate servers to
  provide additional failsafe protection. Balance load on each server in
  a multiple-server architecture to mitigate DDoS attack.

- **Throttling**: Set routers to access a server with a logic to
  throttle incoming traffic levels that are safe for the server.
  Throttling helps in preventing damage to servers by controlling the
  DoS traffic. Can be extended to throttle DDoS attack traffic and allow
  legitimate user traffic for better results.

- **Drop Request**: Drop packets when a load increases.

### Post-Attack Forensics 

- **DDoS attack traffic** patterns can help network administrators to
  develop new filtering techniques for preventing attack traffic from
  entering or leaving the networks.

- Analyse router, firewall, and IDS logs to identify source of DoS
  traffic. Try to trace back attacker IPs with the help of intermediary
  ISPs and law enforcement agencies.

- **Traffic pattern analysis**: Data can be analysed - post-attack - to
  look for specific characteristics within the attacking traffic.

- Using these characteristics, the result of traffic pattern analysis
  can be used for updating load-balancing and throttling
  countermeasures.

### DDoS Protection at ISP Level 

- Most ISPs simply block all the requests during a DDoS attack, denying
  even the legitimate traffic from accessing the service.

- ISPs offer in-the-cloud DDoS protection for Internet links so that
  they do not become saturated by the attack.

- Attack traffic is redirected to the ISP during the attack to be
  filtered and sent back.

- Administrators can request ISPs to block the original affected IP and
  move their site to another IP after performing DNS propagation.

 

### TCP Intercept on Cisco IOS Software 

To enable TCP intercept, use these commands in global configuration
mode:

- Define an IP extended access list: access-list {deny \| permit} tcp
  anydestination destination-wildcard

- Enable TCP Intercept: ip tcp Intercept list access-list-number

TCP intercept can operate in either active intercept mode or passive
watch mode. The default is intercept mode.

The command to set the TCP intercept mode in global configuration mode:
Set the TCP intercept mode: ip tcp intercept mode {intercept \| watch}

## QnA DDoS

**What is the three-way handshake? How can it be used to create a DOS
attack?**

3-way handshake is a cornerstone of the TCP suite: SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK.

- **SYN** is the outgoing connection request from client to server.

- **SYN/ACK** is the acknowledgement of the server back to the client,
  saying that yes, I hear you, let us open a connection.

- **ACK** is the final connection, and allows the two to speak.

The problem is that this can be used as a very basic type of
denial-of-service attack.

- Client opens the SYN connection, the server responds with the SYN/ACK,
  but then the client sends another SYN.

- Server treats this as a new connection request and keeps the previous
  connection open.

- As this is repeated over and over many times very quickly, the server
  quickly becomes saturated with a huge number of connection requests,
  eventually overloading its ability to connect to legitimate users.

**What is a DDOS attack and how to stop and prevent them?**

- A DDOS (distributed denial-of-service ) is a malicious attempt of
  disrupting regular traffic of a network by flooding with a large
  number of requests and making the 598\[’22.458932server unavailable to
  the appropriate requests. The requests come from several unauthorized
  \*+++

- 

- 666606985\]sources and hence called distributed denial of service
  attack.

- Prevent DDoS Attacks:

  - Build a denial of service response plan

  - Employ basic network security

  - Maintain strong network architecture

  - Understand the Warning Signs

  - Consider DDoS as a service

- Generally done by this sometimes happens due to a client
  misconfiguration.

- The objective of a denial of service (DoS) attack is to overwhelm the
  resources of a target system and cause it to stop functioning, denying
  access to its users. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) is a variant
  of DoS in which attackers compromise a large number of computers or
  other devices, and use them in a coordinated attack against the target
  system.

- DDoS attacks are often used in combination with other cyber threats.

- These attacks may launch a denial of service to capture the attention
  of security staff and create confusion, while they carry out more
  subtle attacks aimed at stealing data or causing other damage.

- **Methods of DDoS attacks include:**

  - **Botnets**: Systems under hacker control that have been infected
    with malware. Attackers use these bots to carry out DDoS attacks.
    Large botnets can include millions of devices and can launch attacks
    at devastating scale.

  - **Smurf attack**: Sends Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
    echo requests to the victim’s IP address. The ICMP requests are
    generated from ‘spoofed’ IP addresses. Attackers automate this
    process and perform it at scale to overwhelm a target syst-6em.

  - **TCP SYN flood attack**: Attacks flood the target system with
    connection requests. When the target system attempts to complete the
    connection, the attacker’s device does not respond, forcing the
    target system to time out. This quickly fills the connection queue,
    preventing legitimate users from connecting.

- The following two attacks are less common today, as they rely on
  vulnerabilities in the internet protocol (IP) which have been
  addressed on most servers and networks.

  - **Teardrop attack** causes the length and fragmentation offset
    fields in IP packets to overlap. The targeted system tries to
    reconstruct packets but fails, which can cause it to crash.

  - **Ping of death attack**: pings a target system using malformed or
    oversized IP packets, causing the target system to crash or freeze.

- During a DDoS attack, the botnet sends an overwhelming number of
  requests to a targeted server or application, causing it to crash.
  Network layer DDoS attacks use SYN floods, UDP floods, DNS
  amplification, and other techniques designed to eat up the target’s
  bandwidth and prevent legitimate requests from being served.
  Application-layer DDoS attacks use HTTP floods, Slowloris or RUDY
  attacks, zero-day attacks and other attacks that target
  vulnerabilities in an operating system, application, or protocol in
  order to crash a particular application.

 

**What is a Denial-of-Service Attack?**

- Denial of Service (DoS) is an attack on a computer or network that
  reduces, restricts or prevents accessibility of system resources to
  its legitimate users.

- In a DoS attack, attackers flood a victim system with non-legitimate
  service requests or traffic to overload its resources.

- DoS attack leads to unavailability of a particular website and show
  network performance.

 

**What are Distributed Denial of Service Attacks?**

- A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack involves a multitude of
  compromised systems attacking a single target, thereby causing denial
  of service for users of the targeted system. To launch a DDoS attack,
  an attacker uses botnets and attacks a single system.

 

## DoS/DDoS Attacks 

1.  **Volumetric Attacks**: Consumes the bandwidth of target network or
    service.

2.  **Fragmentation Attacks**: Overwhelms target's ability of
    re-assembling the fragmented packets.

3.  **TCP State-Exhaustion Attacks**: Consumes the connection state
    tables present in the network infrastructure components such as
    load-balancers, firewalls, and application servers.

4.  **Application Layer Attacks**: Consumes the application resources or
    service thereby making it unavailable to other legitimate users.

 

### DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques 

- Bandwidth Attacks

- Service Request Floods

- SYN Flooding Attack

- ICMP Flood Attack

- Peer-to-Peer Attacks

- Application-Level Flood Attacks

- Permanent Denial-of-Service Attack

- Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DrDoS)

 

### Bandwidth Attacks 

- A single machine cannot make enough requests to overwhelm network
  equipment; hence DDoS attacks were created where an attacker uses
  several computers to flood a victim.

- When a DDoS attack is launched,

- flooding a network, it can cause network equipment such as switches
  and routers to be overwhelmed due to the significant statistical
  change in the network traffic.

- Attackers use botnets and carry out DDoS attacks by flooding the
  network with ICMP ECHO packets.

- Basically, all bandwidth is used and no bandwidth remains for
  legitimate use.

 

### Service Request Floods 

- An attacker or group of zombies attempts to exhaust server resources
  by setting up and tearing down TCP connections.

- Service request flood attacks flood servers with a high rate of
  connections from a valid source.

- It initiates a request on every connection.

 

### SYN Flooding Attack 

- The attacker sends a large number of SYN requests to the target server
  (victim) with fake source IP addresses.

- The target machine sends back a SYN/ACK in response to the request and
  waits for the ACK to complete the session setup.

- The target machine does not get the response because the source
  address is fake.

- **Three-way handshake**

  - TCP SYN request

  - SYN/ACK

  - ACK response

 

### SYN Flooding 

- SYN Flooding takes advantage of a flaw in how most hosts implement the
  TCP three-way handshake.

- When Host B receives the SYN request from A, it must keep track of the
  partially opened connection in a "listen queue" for at least 75
  seconds.

- A malicious host can exploit the small size of the listen queue by
  sending multiple SYN requests to a host, but never replying to the
  SYN/ACK.

- The victim's listening queue is quickly filled up.

- The ability of holding up each incomplete connection for 75 seconds
  can be cumulatively used as a Denial-of-Service attack.

### ICMP Flood Attack 

- ICMP flood attack is a type DoS attack in which perpetrators send a
  large number of ICMP packets directly or through reflection networks
  to victims causing it to be overwhelmed and subsequently stop
  responding to legitimate TCP/IP requests.

- To protect against ICMP flood attack, set a threshold limit that when
  exceeded invokes the ICMP flood attack protection feature.

 

### Peer-to-Peer Attacks 

- Using peer-to-peer attacks, attackers instruct clients of peer-to-peer
  file sharing hubs to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and to
  connect to the victim's fake website.

- Attackers exploit flaws found in the network using DC++ (Direct
  Connect) protocol, that is used for sharing all types of files between
  instant messaging clients.

- Using this method, attackers launch massive denial-of-service attacks
  and compromise websites.

- DC++ (Direct Connect) protocol -the attacker acts as a "puppet
  master," instructing clients of large peer-to-peer file sharing hubs
  to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and to connect to the
  victim's website instead.

 

### Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) Attack 

- **Phlashing**: Permanent DoS, also known as phlashing, refers to
  attacks that cause irreversible damage to system hardware.

- **Sabotage**: Unlike other DoS attacks, it sabotages the system
  hardware, requiring the victim to replace or reinstall the hardware.

- **Bricking a system**: This attack is carried out using a method known
  as "bricking a system" in this attackers send fraudulent hardware
  updates to the victims.

 

### Application-Level Flood Attacks 

- Application-level flood attacks result in the loss of services of a
  particular network, such as emails, network resources, the temporary
  ceasing of applications and services, and more.

- Using this attack, attackers exploit weaknesses in programming source
  code to prevent the application from processing legitimate requests.

- Using application-level flood attacks, attackers attempts to:

  - Flood web applications to legitimate user traffic.

  - Disrupt service to a specific system or person, for example,
    blocking a user's access by repeating invalid login attempts.

  - Jam the application-database connection by crafting malicious SQL
    queries.

 

### Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DrDOS) 

- A distributed reflected denial of service attack (DRDoS), also known
  as spoofed attack, involves the use of multiple intermediate and
  secondary machines that contribute to the actual DDoS attack against
  the target machine or application.

- Attacker launches this attack by sending requests to the intermediary
  hosts, these requests are then redirected to the secondary machines
  which in turn reflects the attack traffic to the target.

- In this attack the primary target seems to be directly attacked by the
  secondary victim, not the actual attacker.

- IN this attack as multiple intermediary victim servers are used which
  results in an increase in attack bandwidth.

>  

## Botnet 

- Bots are software applications that run automated tasks over the
  Internet and perform simple repetitive tasks, such as web spidering
  and search engine indexing.

- A botnet is a huge network of the compromised systems and can be used
  by an attacker to launch denial-of-service attacks.

 

### Scanning Methods for Finding Vulnerable Machines 

- **Random Scanning**: The infected machine probes IP addresses randomly
  from target network IP range and checks for the vulnerability.

- **Hit-list Scanning**: Attacker first collects a list of possible
  potentially vulnerable machines and then performs scanning to find
  vulnerable machines.

- **Topological Scanning**: It uses the information obtained on infected
  machines to find new vulnerable machines.

- **Local Subnet Scanning**: The infected machine looks for the new
  vulnerable machine in its own local network.

- **Permutation Scanning**: It uses a pseudorandom permutation list of
  IP addresses to find new vulnerable machines. Divide and conquer

 

**How Malicious Code Propagates?**

Attackers use three techniques to propagate malicious code to newly
discovered vulnerable system:

- **Central Source Propagation**: Attacker places attack toolkit on the
  central source and copy of the attack toolkit is transferred to newly
  discovered vulnerable system.

- **Back-chaining Propagation**: Attacker places attack toolkit on
  his/her system itself and copy of the attack toolkit is transferred to
  newly discovered vulnerable system.

<!-- -->

- **Autonomous Propagation**: Attack toolkit is transferred at the time
  when the new vulnerable system is discovered.

**Blackshades NET - a botnet trojan**

- Blackshades NET has the ability to create implant binaries which
  employ custom obfuscation algorithms or Crypters, which can be bought
  through the Bot/Crypter marketplace embedded in the Blackshades
  controller.

- Other botnet: Cythosia Botnet, Andromeda Bot, Mirai botnet

**PlugBot - a botnet trojan**

- PlugBot is a hardware botnet project.

- It is a covert penetration testing device (bot) designed for covert
  use during physical penetration tests.

## DDoS Countermeasures 

1.  **Detection Techniques**

    - **Detection techniques are based on identifying and discriminating
      the illegitimate traffic increase and flash events from legitimate
      packet traffic.**

    - **All detection techniques define an attack as an abnormal and
      noticeable deviation from a threshold of normal network traffic
      statistics.**

      - **Activity Profiling**

      - **Wavelet-based Signal Analysis**

      - **Changepoint Detection**

2.  **Activity Profiling**

    - **An attack is indicated by: An increase in activity levels among
      the network flow clusters. An increase in the overall number of
      distinct clusters (DDoS attack)**

    - **Activity profile is done based on the average packet rate for a
      network flow, which consists of consecutive packets with similar
      packet fields.**

    - **Activity profile is obtained by monitoring the network packet's
      header information.**

    - **Activity Profiling monitors a network packet's header
      information, calculates the average packet rate for a network
      flow.**

3.  **Wavelet-based Signal Analysis**

    - **Wavelet analysis describes an input signal in terms of spectral
      components.**

    - **Wavelets provide for concurrent time and frequency
      description.**

    - **Analysing each spectral window's energy determines the presence
      of anomalies.**

    - **Signal analysis determines the time at which certain frequency
      components are present.**

4.  **Sequential Change-Point Detection**

    - **Isolate Traffic: Change-point detection algorithms isolate
      changes in network traffic statistics caused by attacks.**

    - **Filter Traffic: The algorithms filter the target traffic data by
      address, port, or protocol and store the resultant flow as a time
      series.**

    - **Identify Attack: Sequential change-point detection technique
      uses Cumulative Sum (Cusum) algorithm to identify and locate the
      DoS attacks; the algorithm calculates deviations in the actual
      versus expected local average in the traffic time series.**

    - **Identify Scan Activity: This technique can also be used to
      identify the typical scanning activities of the network worms.**

5.  **DoS/DDoS Countermeasure Strategies**

    - **Absorbing the Attack: Use additional capacity to absorb attack;
      it requires preplanning. It requires additional resources.**

    - **Degrading Services: Identify critical services and stop non
      critical services.**

    - **Shutting Down the Services: Shut down all the services until the
      attack has subsided.**

## DDoS Attack Countermeasures 

1.  **Protect Secondary Victims**

    - **Install anti-virus and anti-Trojan software and keep these
      up-to-date.**

    - **Increase awareness of security issues and prevention techniques
      in all Internet users.**

    - **Disable unnecessary services, uninstall unused applications, and
      scan all the files received from external sources.**

    - **Properly configure and regularly update the built-in defensive
      mechanisms in the core hardware and software of the system.**

2.  **Detect and Neutralize Handlers**

    - **Network Traffic Analysis: Analyse communication protocols and
      traffic patterns between handlers and clients or handlers and
      agents in order to identify the network nodes that might be
      infected by the handlers.**

    - **Neutralize Botnet Handlers: There are usually few DDoS handlers
      deployed as compared to the number of agents. Neutralizing a few
      handlers can possibly render multiple agents useless, thus
      thwarting DDoS attacks.**

    - **Spoofed Source Address: There is a decent probability that the
      spoofed source address of DDoS attack packets will not represent a
      valid source address of the definite sub-network.**

3.  **Detect Potential Attacks**

    - **Egress Filtering: Scanning packet headers of IP packets leaving
      a network. Egress filtering ensures that unauthorized or malicious
      traffic never leaves internal network.**

    - **Ingress Filtering: Protects from flooding attacks which
      originate from the valid prefixes (IP address)**

    - **It enables the originator to be traced to its true source.**

    - **TCP Intercept: Configuring TCP Intercept prevents DoS attacks by
      intercepting and validating the TCP connection requests.**

4.  **Deflect Attacks**

    - **Systems that are set up with limited security, also known as
      Honeypots, act as an enticement for an attacker.**

    - **Honeypots serve as a means for gaining information about
      attackers, attack techniques and tools by storing a record of the
      system activities.**

    - **Use Defense-in-depth approach with IDSes at different network
      points to divert suspicious DoS traffic to several honeypots.**

    - **Low-interaction honeypots: All services offered by a Low
      Interaction Honeypots are emulated.**

    - **High-interaction honeypots: (honeynet) High Interaction
      Honeypots make use of the actual vulnerable service or software.**

    - **KFSensor: KFSensor is a Windows-based honeypot IDS.**

5.  **Mitigate Attacks**

    - **Load Balancing: Increase bandwidth on critical connections to
      absorb additional traffic generated by an attack. Replicate
      servers to provide additional failsafe protection. Balance load on
      each server in a multiple-server architecture to mitigate DDoS
      attack.**

    - **Throttling: Set routers to access a server with a logic to
      throttle incoming traffic levels that are safe for the server.
      Throttling helps in preventing damage to servers by controlling
      the DoS traffic. Can be extended to throttle DDoS attack traffic
      and allow legitimate user traffic for better results.**

    - **Drop Request: Drop packets when a load increases.**

6.  **Post-Attack Forensics**

    - **DDoS attack traffic patterns can help network administrators to
      develop new filtering techniques for preventing attack traffic
      from entering or leaving the networks.**

    - **Analyse router, firewall, and IDS logs to identify source of DoS
      traffic. Try to trace back attacker IP's with the help of
      intermediary ISPs and law enforcement agencies.**

    - **Traffic pattern analysis: Data can be analysed - post-attack -
      to look for specific characteristics within the attacking
      traffic.**

    - **Using these characteristics, the result of traffic pattern
      analysis can be used for updating load-balancing and throttling
      countermeasures.**

 

## Techniques to Defend against Botnets 

- **RFC 3704 Filtering**: Any traffic coming from unused or reserved IP
  addresses is bogus and should be filtered at the ISP before it enters
  the Internet link.

- **Cisco IPS Source IP Reputation Filtering**: Reputation services help
  in determining if an IP or service is a source of threat or not, Cisco
  IPS regularly updates its database with known threats such as botnets,
  botnet harvesters, malwares, etc. and helps in filtering DoS traffic.

- **Black Hole Filtering**: Black hole refers to network nodes where
  incoming traffic is discarded or dropped without informing the source
  that the data did not reach its intended recipient. Black hole
  filtering refers to discarding packets at the routing level.

<!-- -->

- **DDoS Prevention Offerings from ISP or DDoS Service**: Enable IP
  Source Guard (in CISCO) or similar features in other routers to filter
  traffic based on the DHCP snooping binding database or IP source
  bindings which prevents a bot from sending spoofed packets.

 

## DoS/DDoS Countermeasures 

- Use strong encryption mechanisms such as WPA2, AES 256, etc. for
  broadband networks to withstand eavesdropping.

- Ensure that the software and protocols are up-to-date and scan the
  machines thoroughly to detect any anomalous behaviour.

- Disable unused and insecure services.

- Block all inbound packets originating from the service ports to block
  the traffic from reflection servers.

- Update kernel to the latest release.

- Prevent the transmission of the fraudulently addressed packets at ISP
  level.

- Implement cognitive radios in the physical layer to handle the jamming
  and scrambling attacks.

- Configure the firewall to deny external ICMP traffic access.

- Perform the thorough input validation.

- Prevent use of unnecessary functions such as gets, strcpy etc.

- Secure the remote administration and connectivity testing.

- Data processed by the attacker should be stopped from being executed.

- Prevent the return addresses from being overwritten.

 

### DoS/DDoS Protection at ISP Level 

- Most ISPs simply block all the requests during a DDoS attack, denying
  even the legitimate traffic from accessing the service.

- ISPs offer in-the-cloud DDoS protection for Internet links so that
  they do not become saturated by the attack.

- Attack traffic is redirected to the ISP during the attack to be
  filtered and sent back.

- Administrators can request ISPs to block the original affected IP and
  move their site to another IP after performing DNS propagation.

 

### Enabling TCP Intercept on Cisco IOS Software 

- To enable TCP intercept, use these commands in global configuration
  mode:

  - Define an IP extended access list: access-list {deny \| permit} tcp
    anydestination destination-wildcard

  - Enable TCP Intercept: ip tcp Intercept list access-list-number

- TCP intercept can operate in either active intercept mode or passive
  watch mode. The default is intercept mode.

- The command to set the TCP intercept mode in global configuration
  mode: Set the TCP intercept mode: ip tcp intercept mode {intercept \|
  watch}

# DDoS

> What is a Denial-of-Service Attack?

- Denial of Service (DoS) is an attack on a computer or network that
  reduces, restricts or prevents accessibility of system resources to
  its legitimate users.

- In a DoS attack, attackers flood a victim system with non-legitimate
  service requests or traffic to overload its resources.

- DoS attack leads to unavailability of a particular website and show
  network performance.

> What are Distributed Denial of Service Attacks?
>
> A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack involves a multitude of
> compromised systems attacking a single target, thereby causing denial
> of service for users of the targeted system.

- To launch a DDoS attack, an attacker uses botnets and attacks a single
  system.

DoS/DDoS Attacks

> Basic Categories of DoS/DDoS Attack Vectors

- **Volumetric Attacks**: Consumes the bandwidth of target network or
  service.

- **Fragmentation Attacks**: Overwhelms target's ability of
  re-assembling the fragmented packets.

- **TCP State-Exhaustion Attacks**: Consumes the connection state tables
  present in the network infrastructure components such as
  load-balancers, firewalls, and application servers.

- **Application Layer Attacks**: Consumes the application resources or
  service thereby making it unavailable to other legitimate users.

> DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques

- Bandwidth Attacks and Service Request Floods

- SYN Flooding Attack

- ICMP Flood Attack

- Peer-to-Peer Attacks

- Application-Level Flood Attacks

- Permanent Denial-of-Service Attack

- Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DrDoS)

> Bandwidth Attacks

- A single machine cannot make enough requests to overwhelm network
  equipment; hence DDoS attacks were created where an attacker uses
  several computers to flood a victim.

- When a DDoS attack is launched, flooding a network, it can cause
  network equipment such as switches and routers to be overwhelmed due
  to the significant statistical change in the network traffic.

- Attackers use botnets and carry out DDoS attacks by flooding the
  network with ICMP ECHO packets.

- Basically, all bandwidth is used and no bandwidth remains for
  legitimate use.

> Service Request Floods

- An attacker or group of zombies attempts to exhaust server resources
  by setting up and tearing down TCP connections.

- Service request flood attacks flood servers with a high rate of
  connections from a valid source.

- It initiates a request on every connection.

> SYN Attack

- The attacker sends a large number of SYN requests to the target server
  (victim) with fake source IP addresses.

- The target machine sends back a SYN/ACK in response to the request and
  waits for the ACK to complete the session setup.

- The target machine does not get the response because the source
  address is fake.

> three-way handshake

1.  TCP SYN request

2.  SYN/ACK

3.  ACK response

> SYN Flooding

1.  SYN Flooding takes advantage of a flaw in how most hosts implement
    the TCP threeway handshake.

2.  When Host B receives the SYN request from A, it must keep track of
    the partiallyopened connection in a "listen queue" for at least 75
    seconds.

3.  A malicious host can exploit the small size of the listen queue by
    sending multiple SYN requests to a host, but never replying to the
    SYN/ACK.

4.  The victim's listening queue is quickly filled up.

5.  The ability of holding up each incomplete connection for 75 seconds
    can be cumulatively used as a Denial-of-Service attack.

> ICMP Flood Attack

- ICMP flood attack is a type DoS attack in which perpetrators send a
  large number of ICMP packets directly or through reflection networks
  to victims causing it to be overwhelmed and subsequently stop
  responding to legitimate TCP/IP requests.

- To protect against ICMP flood attack, set a threshold limit that when
  exceeded invokes the ICMP flood attack protection feature.

> Peer-to-Peer Attacks

- Using peer-to-peer attacks, attackers instruct clients of peer-to-peer
  file sharing hubs to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and to
  connect to the victim's fake website.

- Attackers exploit flaws found in the network using DC++ (Direct
  Connect) protocol, that is used for sharing all types of files between
  instant messaging clients.

- Using this method, attackers launch massive denial-of-service attacks
  and compromise websites.

- DC++ (Direct Connect) protocol -the attacker acts as a "puppet
  master," instructing clients of large peer-to-peer file sharing hubs
  to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and to connect to the
  victim's website instead.

> Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) Attack

- **Phlashing**:

  1.  Permanent DoS, also known as phlashing, refers to attacks that
      cause irreversible damage to system hardware.

- **Sabotage**:

  1.  Unlike other DoS attacks, it sabotages the system hardware,
      requiring the victim to replace or reinstall the hardware.

- **Bricking a system**:

  1.  This attack is carried out using a method known as "bricking a
      system"

> ○ Using this method, attackers send fraudulent hardware updates to the
> victims.
>
> Application-Level Flood Attacks

- Application-level flood attacks result in the loss of services of a
  particular network, such as emails, network resources, the temporary
  ceasing of applications and services, and more.

- Using this attack, attackers exploit weaknesses in programming source
  code to prevent the application from processing legitimate requests.

- **Using application-level flood attacks, attackers attempts to:**

  1.  Flood web applications to legitimate user traffic.

> ○ Disrupt service to a specific system or person, for example,
> blocking a user's access by repeating invalid login attempts.
>
> ○ Jam the application-database connection by crafting malicious SQL
> queries.
>
> Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS)

- A distributed reflected denial of service attack (DRDoS), also known
  as spoofed attack, involves the use of multiple intermediate and
  secondary machines that contribute to the actual DDoS attack against
  the target machine or application.

- Attacker launches this attack by sending requests to the intermediary
  hosts, these requests are then redirected to the secondary machines
  which in turn reflects the attack traffic to the target.

- Advantage:

  1.  The primary target seems to be directly attacked by the secondary
      victim, not the actual attacker.

> ○ As multiple intermediary victim servers are used which results in an
> increase in attack bandwidth.

Botnet

- Bots are software applications that run automated tasks over the
  Internet and perform simple repetitive tasks, such as web spidering
  and search engine indexing.

- A botnet is a huge network of the compromised systems and can be used
  by an attacker to launch denial-of-service attacks.

> Scanning Methods for Finding Vulnerable Machines

- **Random Scanning**: The infected machine probes IP addresses randomly
  from target network IP range and checks for the vulnerability.

- **Hit-list Scanning**: Attacker first collects a list of possible
  potentially vulnerable machines and then performs scanning to find
  vulnerable machines.

- **Topological Scanning**: It uses the information obtained on infected
  machines to find new vulnerable machines.

- **Local Subnet Scanning**: The infected machine looks for the new
  vulnerable machine in its own local network.

- **Permutation Scanning**: It uses a pseudorandom permutation list of
  IP addresses to find new vulnerable machines. Divide and conquer

> How Malicious Code Propagates?

- Attackers use three techniques to propagate malicious code to newly
  discovered vulnerable system:

> ○ **Central Source Propagation**: Attacker places attack toolkit on
> the central source and copy of the attack toolkit is transferred to
> the newly discovered vulnerable system.
>
> ○ **Back-chaining Propagation**: Attacker places attack toolkit on
> his/her system itself and copy of the attack toolkit is transferred to
> the newly discovered vulnerable system.
>
> ○ **Autonomous Propagation**: Attack toolkit is transferred at the
> time when the new vulnerable system is discovered.
>
> Botnet Trojan: Blackshades NET

- Blackshades NET has the ability to create implant binaries which
  employ custom obfuscation algorithms or Crypters, which can be bought
  through the Bot/Crypter marketplace embedded in the BlackShades
  controller.

> Other botnes: Cythosia Botnet, Andromeda Bot, Mirai botnet
>
> Botnet Trojan: PlugBot

- PlugBot is a hardware botnet project.

- It is a covert penetration testing device (bot) designed for covert
  use during physical penetration tests.

DoS/DDoS Tools

> DoS and DDoS Attack Tool: Pandora DDoS Bot Toolkit

- The Pandora DDoS Bot Toolkit is an updated variant of the Dirt Jumper
  DDoS toolkit.

- It offers five distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack modes.

- **It generates five attack types**:

  1.  HTTP min

> ○ HTTP download
>
> ○ HTTP Combo
>
> ○ Socket Connect
>
> ○ Max Flood
>
> DoS and DDoS Attack Tools: Dereil and HOIC

- **Dereil**: Dereil is professional (DDoS) Tools with modern patterns
  for attack via TCP, UDP, and HTTP protocols.

- **HOIC**: HOIC makes DDoS attacks to any IP address, with a user
  selected port and a user selected protocol.

> DoS and DDoS Attack Tools: DoS HTTP and BanglaDos

- **DoS HTTP**:

      Windows

> ○ It includes URL verification, HTTP redirection, port designation,
> performance monitoring and enhanced reporting.
>
> ○ It uses multiple asynchronous sockets to perform an effective HTTP
> Flood. ● **BanglaDos**
>
> DoS and DDoS Attack Tools
>
> DoS and DDoS Attack Tool for Mobile: AnDOSid

- AnDOSid allows attackers to simulate a DOS attack (A http post flood
  attack to be exact) and DDoS attack on a web server from mobile
  phones.

> DoS and DDoS Attack Tool for Mobile: Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC)

- Android version of Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) software is used for
  flooding packets which allows attackers to perform DDoS attacks on
  target organization.

DDoS Countermeasures

> Detection Techniques

- Detection techniques are based on identifying and discriminating the
  illegitimate traffic increase and flash events from legitimate packet
  traffic.

- All detection techniques define an attack as an abnormal and
  noticeable deviation from a threshold of normal network traffic
  statistics.

1.  Activity Profiling

2.  Wavelet-based Signal Analysis

3.  Changepoint Detection

> Activity Profiling

- An attack is indicated by:

  1.  An increase in activity levels among the network flow clusters.

> ○ An increase in the overall number of distinct clusters (DDoS attack)

- Activity profile is done based on the average packet rate for a
  network flow, which consists of consecutive packets with similar
  packet fields.

- Activity profile is obtained by monitoring the network packet's header
  information.

> Activity Profiling monitors a network packet's header information,
> calculates the average packet rate for a network flow.
>
> Wavelet-based Signal Analysis

- Wavelet analysis describes an input signal in terms of spectral
  components.

- Wavelets provide for concurrent time and frequency description.

- Analyzing each spectral window's energy determines the presence of
  anomalies.

- Signal analysis determines the time at which certain frequency
  components are present.

> Sequential Change-Point Detection

- **Isolate Traffic**: Change-point detection algorithms isolate changes
  in network traffic statistics caused by attacks.

- **Filter Traffic**: The algorithms filter the target traffic data by
  address, port, or protocol and store the resultant flow as a time
  series.

> **Identify Attack**: Sequential change-point detection technique uses
> Cumulative Sum (Cusum) algorithm to identify and locate the DoS
> attacks; the algorithm calculates deviations in the actual versus
> expected local average in the traffic time series.

- **Identify Scan Activity**: This technique can also be used to
  identify the typical scanning activities of the network worms.

> DoS/DDoS Countermeasure Strategies

- **Absorbing the Attack**:

  1.  Use additional capacity to absorb attack; it requires preplanning.
      ○ It requires additional resources.

- **Degrading Services**:

  1.  Identify critical services and stop non critical services.

- **Shutting Down the Services**:

  1.  Shut down all the services until the attack has subsided.

- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Analyze communication protocols and
  traffic patterns between handlers and clients or handlers and agents
  in order to identify the network nodes that might be infected by the
  handlers.

- **Neutralize Botnet Handlers**: There are usually few DDoS handlers
  deployed as compared to the number of agents. Neutralizing a few
  handlers can possibly render multiple agents useless, thus thwarting
  DDoS attacks.

- **Spoofed Source Address**: There is a decent probability that the
  spoofed source address of DDoS attack packets will not represent a
  valid source address of the definite sub-network.

> DoS/DDoS Countermeasures: Detect Potential Attacks

- **Egress Filtering**:

  1.  Scanning the packet headers of IP packets leaving a network.

> ○ Egress filtering ensures that unauthorized or malicious traffic
> never leaves the internal network.

- **Ingress Filtering**:

  1.  Protects from flooding attacks which originate from the valid
      prefixes (IP address) ○ It enables the originator to be traced to
      its true source.

  activities.

- Use defense-in-depth approach with IPSes at different network points
  to divert suspicious DoS traffic to several honeypots.

- **Drop Request**:

  1.  Drop packets when a load increases.

> Post-Attack Forensics

- DDoS attack traffic patterns can help the network administrators to
  develop new filtering techniques for preventing the attack traffic
  from entering or leaving the networks.

- Analyze router, firewall, and IDS logs to identify the source of the
  DoS traffic. Try to trace back attacker IP's with the help of
  intermediary ISPs and law enforcement agencies.

- Traffic pattern analysis: Data can be analyzed - post-attack - to look
  for specific characteristics within the attacking traffic.

- Using these characteristics, the result of traffic pattern analysis
  can be used for updating load-balancing and throttling
  countermeasures.

# Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

- Generally done by flooding the service or network with more requests
  than can be serviced, which results in the service becoming
  unreachable. This sometimes happens due to a client misconfiguration.

- The objective of a denial of service (DoS) attack is to overwhelm the
  resources of a target system and cause it to stop functioning, denying
  access to its users. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) is a variant
  of DoS in which attackers compromise a large number of computers or
  other devices, and use them in a coordinated attack against the target
  system.

- DDoS attacks are often used in combination with other cyber threats.
  These attacks may launch a denial of service to capture the attention
  of security staff and crea confusion, while they carry out more subtle
  attacks aimed at stealing data or causing other damage

**Method of DDoS**

- **Methods of DDoS attacks include:**

- **Botnets**: Systems under hacker control that have been infected with
  malware. Attackers use these bots to carry out DDoS attacks. Large
  botnets can include millions of devices and can launch attacks at
  devastating scale.

- **Smurf attack**: Sends Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo
  requests to the victim’s IP address. The ICMP requests are generated
  from ‘spoofed’ IP addresses. Attackers automate this process and
  perform it at scale to overwhelm a target system.

- **TCP SYN flood attack**: Attacks flood the target system with
  connection requests. When the target system attempts to complete the
  connection, the attacker’s device does not respond, forcing the target
  system to time out. This quickly fills the connection queue,
  preventing legitimate users from connecting.

- The following two attacks are less common today, as they rely on
  vulnerabilities in the internet protocol (IP) which have been

- **Teardrop attack** causes the length and fragmentation offset fields
  in IP packets to overlap. The targeted system tries to reconstruct
  packets but fails, which ca cause it to crash.

- **Ping of death attack**: pings a target system using malformed or
  oversized IP packets, causing the target system to crash or freeze.

# DDOS Attack

This again is an important Cybersecurity Interview Question. A
**DDOS(Distributed Denial of Service)** attack is a cyberattack that
causes the servers to refuse to provide services to genuine clients.
DDOS attack can be classified into two types:

**Flooding attacks**: In this type, the hacker sends a huge amount of
traffic to the server which the server cannot handle. And hence, the
server stops functioning. This type of attack is usually executed by
using automated programs that continuously send packets to the server.

**Crash attacks:** In this type, the hackers exploit a bug on the server
resulting in the system to crash and hence the server is not able to
provide service to the clients.

You can prevent DDOS attacks by using the following practices:

- Use Anti-DDOS services

- Configure Firewalls and Routers

- Use Front-End Hardware

- Use Load Balancing

- Handle Spikes in Traffic

- **What is a DDOS attack and how to stop and prevent them?** A DDOS
  (distributed denial-of-service ) is a malicious attempt of disrupting
  regular traffic of a network by flooding with many requests and making
  the server unavailable to the appropriate requests. The requests come
  from several unauthorized sources and hence called distributed denial
  of service attack. The following methods will help you to stop and
  prevent DDOS attacks: Build a denial-of-service response plan, Protect
  your network infrastructure, Employ basic network security, Maintain
  strong network architecture, Understand the Warning Signs, Consider
  DDoS as a service

- What is a DDoS attack?

- **DDoS and its mitigation?** DDoS stands for distributed denial of
  service. When a network/server/application is flooded with large
  number of requests which it is not designed to handle making the
  server unavailable to the legitimate requests. The requests can come
  from different not related sources hence it is a distributed denial of
  service attack. It can be mitigated by analysing and filtering the
  traffic in the scrubbing centres. The scrubbing centres are
  centralized data cleansing station wherein the traffic to a website is
  analysed and the malicious traffic is removed.

- **What is a denial of service (DOS) attack and what are the common
  forms?** DOS attacks involve flooding servers, systems, or networks
  with traffic to cause overconsumption of victim resources. This makes
  it difficult or impossible for legitimate users to access or use
  targeted sites. Common DOS attacks include: Buffer overflow attacks,
  ICMP flood, SYN flood, Teardrop attack, Smurf attack.

- **What is a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS)?** It is an
  attack in which multiple computers attack website, server, or any
  network resource.
