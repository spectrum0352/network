# Network Reconnaissance and Vulnerability Analysis

**Network Reconnaissance**
Network reconnaissance is the initial phase of an attack where attackers gather information about a target network. This information helps identify vulnerabilities and plan attack strategies.

**Network Vulnerability Analysis**
Network enumeration is the process of discovering hosts, services, and vulnerabilities on a network. It is a crucial step in penetration testing and security assessments.

**Network Scanning**
Network scanning is the process of identifying active devices on a network and gathering information about them.

Nmap is a valuable tool for network administrators and security professionals, but it must be used responsibly and with proper authorization. Always prioritize network security and avoid causing harm or disruption.

📌 Overview
Network reconnaissance is the phase of penetration testing where testers (or attackers) gather information about the target’s network by scanning IP ranges and open ports. Port scanning is a primary method used in this phase to discover active services and potential vulnerabilities.

🧭 1. What is Port Scanning?
Port scanning is the process of probing a target system to identify open or active ports and the services running on them. These open ports may reveal critical information that can be exploited or used to strengthen security.
⚙️ Who Uses It?
•	Security Professionals – To assess firewall configurations, validate policies, and discover vulnerabilities.
•	Attackers – To identify weak points in a system for exploitation or mapping the network structure.
⚠️ Ethical Considerations
•	Legal Compliance: Unauthorized port scanning is illegal in many jurisdictions.
•	Responsible Use: Always scan systems you own or have permission to test.

🧪 2. Port Scanning Techniques
Technique	Description
Ping Scan	Identifies live hosts using ICMP ECHO requests
TCP Connect Scan	Attempts full TCP handshake to check if a port is open
TCP Half-Open (SYN)	Sends only SYN packets to identify open ports without completing the handshake
UDP Scan	Sends empty UDP packets to detect services running on UDP ports
Stealth Scans	Includes NULL, FIN, and XMAS scans to bypass firewalls and IDS
Strobe/Fragmented Scan	Sends small, fragmented packets to evade detection by network devices


🔌 3. Common Ports to Monitor
Port	Service
22	Secure Shell (SSH)
25	Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
53	Domain Name System (DNS)
135	Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
2049	Network File System (NFS)

o	Prevent bypass via source-routing or manipulated source ports.
•	🧱 Segmentation:
o	Use network segmentation and least privilege to limit attack surfaces.
•	🚫 Anti-Spoofing & Anti-Scanning:
o	Configure rules to block spoofed IPs and abnormal scan behavior.
________________________________________
🛠️ 5. Tools Commonly Used
•	Nmap: Advanced scanning with OS detection, scripting, and evasion.
•	PathAnalyzerPro: Helps identify network devices and paths.
________________________________________
✅ Summary
Port scanning is a critical reconnaissance technique—whether used for ethical security testing or by threat actors. In Azure environments, it's vital to monitor and restrict network exposure using:
•	Firewall/IDS rules
•	Regular vulnerability assessments
•	Responsible and legal usage policies
Always test your own systems and never scan without permission.

Azure-Specific Recon Tips
1.	Azure DNS Enumeration
o	Look up Azure-hosted domains using dig, nslookup, or dnsrecon.
o	Try zone transfers (AXFR) only if misconfigured (rare in production).
o	Check subdomains using tools like Sublist3r, Amass, or dnsx.
2.	Azure Services Discovery
o	Identify public IPs of services like App Services, SQL databases, VMs.
o	Use nmap to scan for open ports listed above.
o	Look for misconfigured storage accounts (e.g., .blob.core.windows.net).
3.	Azure VM Enumeration
o	Test SSH (port 22) for Linux VMs and RDP (port 3389, not in original list) for Windows VMs.
o	Use tools like nmap, masscan, or az vm list-ip-addresses (with Azure CLI, if internal).

When performing reconnaissance on Azure, especially for security assessments or penetration testing (with permission), it’s important to enumerate key services and ports used across Azure DNS, Azure services, and virtual machines (VMs).

Firewall Evasion

Firewall Evasion Techniques during Network Reconnaissance
Firewall evasion techniques are used to bypass intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and firewalls during reconnaissance. These methods aim to hide or disguise the source and intent of the scan.

Packet Manipulation Techniques

Technique	Description	Command
Fragment Packets	Splits TCP headers into small packets to evade detection.	nmap -f [target]
Set Specific MTU	Alters packet size to bypass filters expecting standard sizes.	nmap --mtu [value] [target]
Append Random Data	Adds extra data to packets to change their signature.	nmap --data-length [size] [target]
Bad Checksums	Sends deliberately malformed packets that some firewalls may ignore.	nmap --badsum [target]

🕵️ Obfuscation & Deception

Technique	Description	Command
Decoy Scanning	Uses decoy IPs to confuse defenders about the true source.	nmap -D RND:[number] [target]
Idle Zombie Scan	Uses a third-party "zombie" host to perform scans, hiding the attacker’s IP.	nmap -sI [zombie] [target]
Source Port Spoofing	Fakes the source port to mimic trusted services (e.g., port 53 for DNS).	nmap --source-port [port] [target]
MAC Address Spoofing	Fakes the MAC address to impersonate another device/vendor.	`nmap --spoof-mac [MAC

🔀 Randomization Techniques

Technique	Description	Command
Randomize Host Order	Scans targets in random order to avoid detection patterns.	nmap --randomize-hosts [target]

✅ Summary:
These Nmap-based firewall evasion techniques are critical for red teamers during reconnaissance in Azure environments, especially when facing network security mechanisms like Azure Firewall, NSGs, and third-party virtual appliances. However, these actions must be performed with proper authorization to avoid legal and ethical violations.

The process of identifying a target’s operating system and software versions is known as TCP/IP fingerprinting

Network Scanning
Firewalls, routers, proxy servers, and other security devices can skew the results of an Nmap scan. 
Scanning remote hosts that are not on your local network may provide misleading information because of this. 
Some scanning options require elevated privileges. Like sudo command. 

Scanning IP Blocks
Attackers’ scans victim IP blocks to gather information that can be used during targeting. Public IP addresses may be allocated to organizations by block, or a range of sequential addresses.

Warnings
Scanning networks that you do not have permission to scan can get you in trouble with your internet service provider, the police, and possibly even the government. Do not go off scanning the FBI or Secret Service websites unless you want to get in trouble. 
Aggressively scanning some systems may cause them to crash which can lead to undesirable results like system downtime and data loss. Always scan mission critical systems with caution.

Extract information using DNS zone transfer

DNS reconnaissance, also known as DNS footprinting, is the process of gathering information about a target network by querying the Domain Name System (DNS). This information can be crucial for attackers to:
•	Identify key network hosts: By analyzing DNS records, attackers can pinpoint critical servers like mail servers, web servers, and domain name servers within the target network.
•	Craft social engineering attacks: Information like domain owner contact details and domain creation date can be used to launch social engineering attacks, where attackers impersonate legitimate users to gain access or information.

Information Gathered Through DNS Reconnaissance:

DNS Records:
o	A (Address): Maps a hostname (e.g., [www.example.com](https://www.example.com/)) to an IP address.
o	MX (Mail Exchange): Points to the mail server(s) responsible for handling email for a domain.
o	NS (Nameserver): Specifies the authoritative nameservers for a domain.
o	CNAME (Canonical Name): Creates an alias for a hostname, pointing it to another hostname.
o	PTR (Pointer): Maps an IP address back to a hostname (reverse DNS lookup).
o	Other Records (SRV, RP, HINFO, TXT): Provide additional information like service location (SRV), responsible person (RP), hardware/OS details (HINFO), and unstructured text data (TXT).

WHOIS Information:
o	Domain name details (creation date, expiry)
o	Contact details of the domain owner (name, email, address)
o	Nameservers for the domain
o	Net range (geographical location)
o	Records last updated

DNS Interrogation Tools:
•	Online tools like http://www.dnsstuff.com/ and http://network-tools.com/ can be used to perform basic DNS lookups.
•	Command-line tools like dig and host are available on most operating systems.

Defending Against DNS Reconnaissance:
•	Limit Information in DNS Records: Avoid including sensitive details like contact information or server types in public DNS records.
•	Restrict Zone Transfers: Disable zone transfers on DNS servers to prevent attackers from obtaining complete network information.
•	Monitor DNS Traffic: Watch for unusual queries or suspicious activity related to your DNS infrastructure.
By understanding DNS reconnaissance techniques and implementing proper security measures, organizations can make it more difficult for attackers to gather valuable information about their networks.

Example:

NSLOOKUP
Resolve given hostname/URL to IP address: >nslookup example.com
Reverse DNS lookup: >nslookup -type=PTR IP_address

MX(Mail Exchange) lookup: >nslookup -type=MX domain

Zone Transfer: 
>nslookup

DNS Footprinting 


1. DNS Enumeration
•	Purpose: Gathering information about a target's DNS infrastructure.
•	Methods: 
o	DNS Zone Transfer (AXFR): 
	This technique attempts to retrieve a complete copy of a domain's DNS zone file from a DNS server.
	If successful, it reveals all hostnames, IP addresses, and other DNS records associated with the domain.
	This is a very powerful technique, but it's often disabled for security reasons.
	Tools: dig, nslookup.
	Example: dig axfr example.com @ns1.example.com
o	DNS Brute-forcing: 
	Trying common hostnames (e.g., www, mail, ftp) or using a wordlist to discover subdomains.
	Tools: dnsrecon, fierce.
o	Reverse DNS Lookup: 
	Mapping IP addresses to hostnames.
	Tools: dig -x, nslookup.
•	Information Extracted: 
o	Hostnames.
o	IP addresses.
o	Mail servers (MX records).
o	Name servers (NS records).
o	Other DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME, TXT, etc.).


DNS Footprinting
DNS footprinting is Collecting information about DNS zone data
Attackers can gather DNS information to determine key hosts in the network and can perform social engineering attacks.
DNS records provide important information about location and type of servers.
•	Name -> IP
•	IP -> Name
•	Service -> Name

DNS Records:
•	A: Maps host name to an IP address
•	MX: Points to domain's mail server
•	NS: Points to host's name server
•	CNAME: Canonical naming allows aliases to a host
•	SDA: Indicate authority for domain
•	SRV: Service records
•	PTR: (pointer) Maps IP address to a hostname
•	RP: Responsible person
•	HINFO: Host information record includes CPU type and OS
•	TXT: Unstructured text records

Potential Information Leakage
While DNS records offer valuable insights, it is crucial to understand that they can also inadvertently reveal sensitive information. For example:
•	Subdomain Enumeration: By systematically trying different subdomains (e.g., [invalid URL removed], [invalid URL removed]), attackers can discover potential vulnerabilities or systems.
•	Service Discovery: DNS records can expose services running on a network, aiding attackers in identifying potential targets.
•	Internal Network Structure: Analysis of DNS records can sometimes reveal internal network structure, providing clues about network topology.
•	Social Engineering: Information gathered through DNS footprinting can be used to craft targeted social engineering attacks.

Mitigation Techniques
To protect against DNS footprinting, consider the following measures:
•	Restrict DNS Zone Transfers: Prevent unauthorized access to DNS zone data.
•	Limit DNS Record Information: Provide only essential information in DNS records.
•	Implement DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC): Enhance DNS data integrity and authenticity.
•	Monitor DNS Traffic: Detect and respond to unusual DNS queries.
•	Employee Awareness: Educate employees about the risks of sharing sensitive information.

Tools for DNS Footprinting
Beyond nslookup and dig, there are several specialized tools for DNS footprinting:
•	Fierce: A popular tool for subdomain discovery and DNS reconnaissance.
•	Maltego: A graphical intelligence tool that can be used for DNS footprinting and correlation.
•	DNSRecon: A Python script for DNS reconnaissance.
•	ZMap: A tool for Internet-wide network discovery, which can also be used for DNS footprinting.

Practical Example
Let us illustrate DNS footprinting with a hypothetical scenario:
An attacker targets a company, example.com. They perform DNS footprinting and discover the following:
•	Multiple subdomains: [invalid URL removed], [invalid URL removed], [invalid URL removed]
•	MX record: points to an external mail server, suggesting potential email vulnerabilities
•	HINFO record: reveals outdated operating system information, indicating potential attack vectors
Based on this information, the attacker can:
•	Attempt to compromise the mail server
•	Exploit vulnerabilities in the outdated operating system
•	Launch targeted phishing attacks against employees
Additional Considerations
•	DNSSEC Validation: Ensure that DNSSEC is properly configured and validated to prevent DNS spoofing and data tampering.
•	Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on DNS queries to mitigate brute-force attacks.
•	Regular Audits: Conduct regular DNS audits to identify potential issues and vulnerabilities.

Whois Footprinting through Search Engines:
WHOIS footprinting involves gathering information about a domain and its owner from the WHOIS database. This data can be accessed through search engines.

Information obtained:
•	Domain name details
•	Contact information of the domain owner
•	Domain name servers
•	Creation and expiration dates of the domain
•	Record update history

Potential misuse:
Attackers can use this information to:
•	Perform social engineering attacks by gathering personal details.
•	Identify potential targets for further attacks.

Mitigation:
Protecting personal information in WHOIS records and being aware of the risks is crucial to prevent misuse.

Network enumeration focuses on extracting specific details about a target network after the initial reconnaissance phase. Here's a breakdown of the techniques mentioned:
•	DNS Enumeration: This involves querying a DNS server for zone transfers. If permitted, it can reveal a wealth of information like internal hostnames, IP addresses, and subdomains within the target network.
•	Extracting Usernames from SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol): SNMP is a protocol used for network device management. In some configurations, it might be possible to leverage SNMP to retrieve usernames or other user information from the target system. This can give attackers a foothold for further attacks.
Why are these techniques useful for attackers?
By using these techniques, attackers can gather valuable information about the target network, such as:
•	Usernames: These can be used in brute-force attacks or social engineering attempts.
•	Internal hostnames: This can help attackers identify critical systems within the network.
•	Network structure: Understanding the network layout allows attackers to target specific devices or services.
How can organizations defend against these techniques?
Here are some steps organizations can take:
•	Disable DNS zone transfers: This prevents attackers from obtaining detailed network information through DNS.
•	Secure SNMP configurations: Limit access to SNMP and restrict the information it reveals.
•	Implement strong password policies: Complex passwords make brute-force attacks more difficult.
•	Monitor network activity: Look for suspicious queries or unauthorized access attempts.

By understanding these enumeration techniques and implementing proper security measures, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks.

# Countermeasures to DNS
•	Disable the DNS zone transfers to the untrusted hosts 
•	Make sure that the private hosts and their IP addresses are not published into DNS zone files of public DNS server 
•	Use premium DNS registration services that hide sensitive information such as HINFO from public 
•	Use standard network admin contacts for DNS registrations to avoid social engineering attacks 

o	Limit Zone Transfers: Disable zone transfers to untrusted hosts to prevent unauthorized information disclosure.
o	Protect Private Information: Don't publish private host IPs or sensitive details like HINFO in public DNS records.
o	Privacy Services: Consider premium DNS registration services that offer privacy features.
o	Standard Contacts: Use standard network admin contacts for DNS registrations to avoid social engineering attacks.

# Recon ‐ NTP

 
NTP Enumeration 

Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a network protocol designed to synchronize the clocks of computer systems over a network. It uses UDP port 123 for communication and can achieve high levels of accuracy, especially in local networks.

Attackers can leverage NTP to gather valuable information:
•	Host Discovery: Identify devices connected to the NTP server.
•	IP Address Enumeration: Discover internal and external IP addresses.
•	OS Fingerprinting: Determine the operating systems of connected devices.

Common NTP Enumeration Tools:
•	ntptrace: Traces the path of NTP requests to the primary time source.
•	ntpdc: Monitors the NTP daemon and provides detailed information about its operation.
•	ntpq: Queries the NTP daemon for specific information and statistics.
By understanding NTP and its potential vulnerabilities, organizations can implement security measures to protect their networks from unauthorized access and information leakage.

•	Network Time Protocol (NTP) is designed to synchronize clocks of networked computers.
•	It uses UDP port 123 as its primary means of communication.   
•	NTP can maintain time to within 10 milliseconds (1/100 seconds) over the public Internet.
•	It can achieve accuracies of 200 microseconds or better in local area networks under ideal conditions.   
•	An attacker can query an NTP server to gather valuable information such as: 
o	List of hosts connected to the NTP server
o	Client IP addresses in a network, their system names, and operating systems
o	Internal IP addresses can also be obtained if the NTP server is in a DMZ.
NTP Enumeration Commands:
•	ntptrace:
o	Traces a chain of NTP servers back to the primary source.
o	Syntax: ntptrace [-vdn] [-r retries] [-t timeout] [server]
•	ntpdc:
o	Monitors the operation of the NTP daemon, ntpd.
o	Syntax: /usr/bin/ntpdc [-n] [-v] host1 | IPaddress1...
•	ntpq:
o	Monitors NTP daemon ntpd operations and determines performance.
o	Syntax: ntpq [-inp] [-c command] [host] [...]
Additional Notes:
•	Older NTP versions were vulnerable to monlist or similar commands within ntpq/ntpdc. These commands could return a list of the last 600 or so hosts that connected to the NTP server. Modern NTP servers should have these commands disabled by default, or be patched against this vulnerability.
•	NTP enumeration can be used to fingerprint operating systems based on the time offsets and other data returned by the NTP server.
•	Properly configured firewalls should block external access to NTP servers, except for necessary traffic.

# Recon ‐ NetBIOS

NetBIOS 

NetBIOS reconnaissance focuses on gathering information about devices and resources on a network using the NetBIOS protocol. NetBIOS is an older naming system primarily used in Windows environments.

Why is NetBIOS reconnaissance useful for attackers?
By exploiting NetBIOS, attackers can potentially obtain valuable information like:
•	List of computers: This helps attackers identify devices within the network.
•	Shared resources: Information about shared folders and printers on network machines.
•	Usernames and passwords: In some cases, weak configurations might reveal usernames or allow access through techniques like null sessions.

NetBIOS Name Format:
•	A unique 16-character string (15 for device name, 1 replaced with service/record type).

NetBIOS Enumeration Techniques:
•	Net view commands: These commands can be used to list shared resources on remote machines or within a workgroup.
o	Examples:
	net view \\<computername>
	net view /workgroup:<workgroupname>
•	Nbtstat utility: This Windows command-line tool displays NetBIOS statistics, name tables, and the name cache.
o	Examples:
	nbtstat.exe -c to view the local NetBIOS name cache.
	nbtstat.exe -a <IP address> to get the NetBIOS name table of a remote machine.

NetBIOS Enumeration Tools:
•	SuperScan: A tool that can scan for open ports and perform NetBIOS name resolution.
•	Hyena: A GUI tool for managing and potentially revealing shares and usernames on Windows systems.
•	Winfingerprint: A tool that can enumerate various details on a Windows machine, including users, shares, and open ports.

By understanding the risks associated with NetBIOS and implementing appropriate security measures, organizations can significantly reduce their exposure to attacks.

# Recon ‐ SNMP

SNMP

Extract usernames from SNMP (MiB, SNMPWAL)
DHCP Enumeration
SMTP Enumeration

2. SNMP Enumeration
•	Purpose: Gathering information about devices and their configurations using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
•	SNMP Basics: 
o	SNMP uses community strings (like passwords) for authentication.
o	Common community strings: public (read-only), private (read-write).
o	SNMP MIBs (Management Information Bases): 
	Databases that define the objects and their properties that can be managed via SNMP.
	They provide a structured way to access device information.
o	SNMPWalk: 
	A tool that retrieves all available SNMP information from a device.
	It iterates through the MIB tree, collecting data.
	Tools: snmpwalk.
	Example: snmpwalk -v 1 -c public target_ip
•	Information Extracted: 
o	System information (hostname, uptime, etc.).
o	Network interfaces and their status.
o	Routing tables.
o	Installed software.
o	Usernames (sometimes).
o	Security Concerns: Default community strings are a significant security risk.
•	Extract usernames from SNMP: 
o	Depending on the device and its configuration, SNMP can sometimes expose usernames. This is usually due to poorly configured MIBs or older SNMP versions.



SNMP 

SNMP Reconnaissance: Unveiling Device Details

SNMP enumeration focuses on extracting information from network devices using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP is a widely used protocol for managing network devices, but it can also be exploited by attackers to gather valuable information.

How SNMP Works:
•	SNMP involves a manager-agent architecture.
•	Agents reside on network devices and collect information.
•	Managers can query agents to retrieve information or change configurations.

Security Concerns with SNMP:
•	Default Community Strings: By default, SNMP uses community strings for authentication, and these strings are often well-known ("public" for read access, "private" for read-write). Attackers can leverage these defaults to gain unauthorized access.
•	Information Leakage: SNMP can reveal a wealth of information about a device, including:
o	Network resources (hosts, routers, devices, shares)
o	Network information (ARP tables, routing tables, traffic)
o	Usernames and other sensitive details (depending on configuration)

SNMP Enumeration Techniques:
•	SNMP Walk Command: Tools like snmpwalk can be used to systematically query an SNMP agent for information.

SNMP Enumeration Tools:
•	OpUtils: A network management suite that includes SNMP enumeration capabilities.
•	Engineer's Toolset: A tool that can discover network devices using SNMP and display information about them.

Defending Against SNMP Reconnaissance:
•	Disable Unused SNMP: If SNMP is not required, disable it on devices to eliminate the attack surface.
•	Strong Community Strings: Use complex, unique community strings for both read and write access.
•	Limit Access: Restrict access to SNMP management to authorized personnel and networks.
•	Monitor SNMP Traffic: Watch for suspicious queries or unauthorized access attempts.

By understanding SNMP enumeration techniques and implementing proper security measures, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of information disclosure and unauthorized configuration changes.

Note: The document you provided included extraneous content about SMTP enumeration and DNS zone transfers. These are separate reconnaissance techniques, not directly related to SNMP.

●	SNMP enumeration is a process of enumerating user accounts and devices on a target system using SNMP. 
●	SNMP consists of a manager and an agent; agents are embedded on every network device, and the manager is installed on a separate computer. 
●	SNMP holds two passwords to access and configure the SNMP agent from the management station: 
○	Read community string: It is public by default; allows viewing of device/system configuration. 
○ Read/write community string: It is private by default; allows remote editing of configuration. 
●	Attackers use these default community strings to extract information about a device. 
●	Attackers enumerate SNMP to extract information about network resources such as hosts, routers, devices, shares, etc. and network information such as ARP tables, routing tables, traffic, etc. 
●	snmpwalk: snmpwalk -v 1 -c public 192.168.99.144 
●	snmpcheck: snmpcheck -t 192.168.99.144 
SNMP Enumeration Tools: 
●	OpUtils: OpUtils with its integrated set of tools helps network engineers to monitor, diagnose, and troubleshoot their IT resources. 
●	Engineer's Toolset: 
○	Engineer's Toolset performs network discovery on a single subnet or a range of subnets using ICMP and SNMP. 
○ It scans a single IP, IP address range, or subnet and displays network devices discovered in real time. 
 
 
SNMP Enumeration 

SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a protocol used to monitor and manage network devices. However, it can be exploited by attackers to gather sensitive information about a network.

How does SNMP Enumeration work?
1.	Default Credentials: SNMP uses community strings for authentication. Default community strings like "public" and "private" are often left unchanged, making it easy for attackers to access devices.
2.	Information Gathering: Attackers can use tools like snmpwalk and snmpcheck to query SNMP agents and extract information such as: 
o	Device information (vendor, model, OS version)
o	Network configuration (IP addresses, subnet masks, routing tables)
o	User accounts and passwords (if poorly configured)
o	System logs and error messages

Mitigation Techniques:
1.	Change Default Community Strings: Assign strong, unique community strings to each device.
2.	Restrict SNMP Access: Limit SNMP access to authorized network administrators.
3.	Implement Network Segmentation: Divide the network into smaller segments to reduce the impact of a potential breach.
4.	Use SNMPv3: SNMPv3 provides stronger security features like encryption and authentication.
5.	Monitor Network Traffic: Regularly monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
6.	Keep Software Up-to-Date: Apply security patches to address vulnerabilities in SNMP agents and management software.

By following these best practices, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of SNMP enumeration attacks and protect their network infrastructure.
## Countermeasures to SNMP
•	Remove the SNMP agent or turn off the SNMP service 
•	If shutting off SNMP is not an option, then change the default community string name 
•	Upgrade to SNMP3, which encrypts passwords and messages 
•	Implement the Group Policy security option called "Additional restrictions for anonymous connections" 
•	Ensure that the access to null session pipes, null session shares, and IPSec filtering is restricted. 
•	SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):
o	Disable: If possible, remove the SNMP agent or turn off the service entirely.
o	Strong Passwords: If disabling isn't an option, change the default community string to a strong, complex password.
o	Encryption: Upgrade to SNMPv3, which encrypts both passwords and messages for better security.
o	Limit Access: Implement security options like "Additional restrictions for anonymous connections" to restrict unauthorized access.
o	Restrict Null Sessions: Ensure access to null session pipes, shares, and IPSec filtering is restricted.

# Port Scanning

Port Scanning Techniques:
There are various port scanning techniques, each with its advantages and limitations. Here are a few examples:
* •	Basic Techniques: Ping scan, TCP connect scan
* •	Stealthier Techniques: TCP half-open scan, NULL scan, FIN scan, X-MAS scan
* •	Advanced Techniques: UDP scan, strobe scan, fragmented packets


Port Scanning: A Double-Edged Sword

Port scanning is a technique used to identify open ports on a computer or network device. These open ports reveal the services running on the device and can be used for both good and bad purposes.

Understanding Port Scanning:
* •	Who Uses It?
  * o	Security Professionals: Used to verify network security policies, identify vulnerabilities, and troubleshoot network issues.
  * o	Attackers: Used to find weaknesses in a system for exploitation or gather information for malicious activities.
* •	Importance: Understanding port scanning is crucial for both security professionals and regular users to protect their devices and networks.

Responsible Use:
* •	Legality: Port scanning without authorization is illegal in most countries.
* •	Ethics: Responsible use is essential to avoid harming others' networks.
* •	Network Security: Firewalls and keeping software updated help mitigate risks associated with open ports.

Common Ports to Scan:
These are some well-known ports and their associated services:
* •	Secure Shell (SSH): 22
* •	Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): 25
* •	Domain Name System (DNS): 53
* •	Remote Procedure Call (RPC): 135
* •	Network File System (NFS): 2049
* •	Many more... (The full list includes 65,535 ports for both TCP and UDP)

Protecting Yourself:
* •	Firewalls and IDS: Configure firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to detect and block suspicious port scanning activity.
* •	Regular Updates: Ensure your network devices (routers, firewalls) and software are updated with the latest security patches.
* •	Custom Firewall Rules: Consider using custom firewall rules to block unwanted ports.
* •	Network Scanning Tools: Use port scanning tools on your own network to test your firewall's effectiveness.


Additional Points:
* •	Network Footprinting tools like PathAnalyzerPro can help identify network devices and their characteristics.
* •	Nmap is a popular open-source port scanner with various features like OS fingerprinting and advanced scan techniques.

Remember: Port scanning is a powerful tool, but use it responsibly and ethically. Always obtain permission before scanning someone else's network.

Port Scanning is the technique used to identify open ports and service available on a host. Hackers use port scanning to find information that can be helpful to exploit vulnerabilities. Administrators use Port Scanning to verify the security policies of the network. Some of the common Port Scanning Techniques are: 
* Ping Scan 
* TCP Half-Open 
* TCP Connect 
* UDP 
* Stealth Scanning 

### Port Scanning Countermeasures 
Configure firewall and IDS rules to detect and block probes. 
* ●	Run the port scanning tools against hosts on the network to determine whether the firewall properly detects the port scanning activity. 
* ●	Ensure that mechanisms used for routing and filtering at the routers and firewalls respectively cannot be bypassed using particular source ports or source-routing methods. 
* ●	Ensure that the router, IDS, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases. 
* ●	Use a custom rule set to lock down the network and block unwanted ports at the firewall. 
* ●	Filter all ICMP messages (i.e. inbound ICMP message types and outbound ICMP type 3 unreachable messages) at the firewalls and routers. 
* ●	Perform TCP and UDP scanning along with ICMP probes against your organization's IP address space to check the network configuration and its available ports. 
* ●	Ensure that the anti scanning and anti spoofing rules are configured.

# NMAP ‐ scaning technique

# Basic scanning technique
* Scan Single Target: By default Nmap scan will check for the 1000 most commonly used TCP/IP ports `nmap 10.10.10.10`	
* Scan Multiple Targets: `nmap 10.10.10.10 10.10.10.11 10.10.10.12`
* Scan IP Address Range: Nmap can be used to scan an entire subnet using CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation. 
  * `nmap 10.10.10.10-12`        
  * `nmap 10.10.10.*`
  * `nmap 10.10.10.10-10.10.*`
  * `nmap 10.10.10.10/24`
* Scan list of targets:	Each entry in the list.txt file must be separated by a space, tab, or newline `nmap list.txt -iL`  	
* Random Scan - It will randomly generate specified number of targets and scan them. Not Recommended `nmap -iR 5`	
* Exclude Targets from Scan: This option accepts single hosts, ranges, or entire network blocks  `nmap 10.10.10.0/24 --exclude 10.10.10.140`
* Exclude Targets Using List: `nmap 10.10.10.0/24 --excludefile list.txt` 
* Aggressive Scan: use -A parameter is a synonym for several advanced options like -O -sC --traceroute `nmap -A 10.10.10.10`	
* Scan IPv6 target: use -6 parameter is used to perform a scan of an IPv6 target `nmap -6 fe80::29aa:9db9:4164:d80e` 

* Fast Scan: 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -F	Scan only 100 most commonly used ports
* Scan specific ports:        	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -p 80, 443, 21-25	 
* Scan ports by name:      	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -p http, smtp, ftp	 
* Scan ports for multiple services by name	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -p "http*"	 
* Scan ports by protocol:  	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -p U:80,T:80 	U:UDP port, T:TCP port
* Scan All ports:                	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -p * 	 
* Show Open Ports: 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --open	 
* Reason for Port State:	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --reason                	 "syn-ack" means ports are open, "conn-refused or reset" means closed
* Scan Top ports: 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --top-ports 20 	Scans specified number of ports
* Sequential port scan:	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -r 	 By default Nmap’s randomizes port scan order. -r overrides this.
* Scan Flags	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --scan-flags	 


# Firewall Evasion
Fragment Packets      	nmap -f [target] 
Specify a Specific MTU      	nmap --mtu [MTU] [target] 
Use a Decoy      	nmap -D RND:[number] [target] 
Idle Zombie Scan      	nmap -sI [zombie] [target] 
Manually Specify a Source Port  	nmap --source-port [port] [target] 
Append Random Data  	nmap --data-length [size] [target] 
Randomize Target Scan Order 	nmap --randomize-hosts [target] 
Spoof MAC Address      	nmap --spoof-mac [MAC|0|vendor] [target] 
Send Bad Checksums 	nmap --badsum [target] 

## Discovery Options
* Don’t Ping: 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -PN	While scanning ports first nmap ping the target to see if it is online then it scans. -PN option instructs Nmap to skip the default discovery check and perform a complete port scan on the target. Nmap is able to produce a list of open ports on the unpingable system. 
* Perform a Ping Only Scan: 	#nmap 10.10.10.0/24  -sP 	Used to perform quick search of the target in the network. -sP option will perform ARP ping and produces MAC addresses.
* TCP SYN Ping: 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -PS 	It sends a SYN packet to target systems. Useful when standard ICMP pings are blocked. Default port for -PS is 80
* TCP ACK Ping 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -PA 	Used to send ACK packets to target systems. Useful when standard ICMP pings are blocked. Default port for -PS is 80
* UDP Ping 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -PU 	Used to send UDP packets to target systems. Useful when TCP connections are blocked. Default port for -PS is 40125
* SCTP INIT Ping 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -PY 	Used to locate hosts using the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). Default port for -PS is 80
* ICMP Echo Ping 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -PE 	Used to send standard ICMP ping to target. -PE option is automatically implied if no other ping options are specified. 
* ICMP Timestamp Ping 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -PP 	Useful when ICMP pings are blocked
* ICMP Address Mask Ping 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -PM 	Used to ping specified host using alternative ICMP registers. Useful when ICMP echo pings are blocked
* IP Protocol Ping 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -PO 1, 2, 4	Used to sends packets with the specified protocol to the target. If no protocols are specified then default protocols 1 (ICMP), 2 (IGMP), and 4 (IP-in-IP) are used
* ARP Ping 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -PR 	The -PR option is automatically implied when scanning the local network. It is much faster than the other ping methods. It is more accurate because LAN hosts can’t block ARP requests. 
* Traceroute 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --traceroute 	Used to trace the network path to the specified host
* Force Reverse DNS Resolution 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -R 	Used to perform reverse DNS resolution on the every target IP address. By default, Nmap will only do reverse DNS for hosts that appear to be online. Reduces performance of scan.
* Disable Reverse DNS Resolution 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -n 	Used to Disable Reverse DNS Resolution. Reduces scanning time when scanning large number of hosts. Used when you don’t care of DNS information
* Alternative DNS Lookup 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --system-dns 	It instructs Nmap to use the host system’s DNS resolver instead of its own internal method. Useful when troubleshooting DNS problems 
* Manually Specify DNS Server(s) 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --dns-servers 	Used to manually specify DNS servers to be queried when scanning
* Create a Host List 	#nmap 10.10.10.0/24 -sL 	The -sL option will display a list and performs a reverse DNS lookup of the specified IP addresses. Useful for identifying the IP addresses and DNS names for the specified targets without sending any packets to them

## Advanced Scanning
* TCP SYN Scan:  Half open scanning	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -sS	because only send syn packets and it does not attempt to open a full-fledged connection to the remote host. Prevents connection logging. (Modern firewall able to detect it) Stealth scan.
* TCP Connect Scan:	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -sT 	 attempts to directly connect to the remote system without using any 
* UDP Scan: 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -sU  	Many services still utilize UDP like DNS, DHCP, SNMP
* TCP Null Scan:  . 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -sN  	used to send packets with no TCP flags enabled. This is done by setting the packet header to 0. Sending NULL packets to a target is a method of tricking a firewalled system to generate a response
* TCP FIN Scan 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -sF	In a -sF scan, Nmap marks the TCP FIN bit active when sending packets in an attempt to solicit a TCP ACK from the specified target system. This is another method of sending unexpected packets to a target in an attempt to produce results from a system protected by a firewall.  
* Xmas Scan	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -sX	Nmap sends packets with URG, FIN, and PSH, and flags activated. This has the effect of “lighting the packet up like a Christmas tree” and can occasionally solicit a response from a firewalled system. 
* TCP ACK Scan 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -sA 	The -sA option can be used to determine if the target system is protected by a firewall. When performing a TCP ACK scan, Nmap will probe a target and look for RST responses. If no response is received the system is considered to be filtered. If the system does return an RST packet, then it is labelled as unfiltered. In the above example 994 ports are labelled as filtered meaning that the system is likely protected by a firewall. The 6 unfiltered ports displayed are likely to have special rules in the target’s firewall that enable them to be open or closed.  The -sA option does not display whether or not the unfiltered ports are open or closed. Its only purpose is to determine whether or not the system is filtering ports. 
* Custom TCP Scan 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --scanflags FINACK	The --scanflags option allows users to define a custom scan using one or more TCP header flags. Any combination of flags listed in the table below can be used  with the --scanflags option.
* SYN=Synchronize, ACK=Acknowledgment, PSH=Push, URG=Urgent, RST=Reset, FIN=Finished 
* IP Protocol Scan 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -sO 	Displays the IP protocols that are supported on the target system. Used to find what types of scans you want to perform on the selected target.
* Send Raw Ethernet Packets 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --send-eth 	Used to bypass the IP layer on your system and send raw ethernet packets on the data link layer
* Send IP Packets 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --send-ip 	Used to scan using the local system’s IP stack instead of generating raw ethernet packets

## OS and Service Detection
* Operating System Detection 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -O  	OS detection is performed by analysing responses from the target for a set of predictable characteristics which can be used to identify the type of OS on the remote system. In order for OS detection to work properly there must be at least one open and one closed port on the target system. When scanning multiple targets, the --osscan-limit option can be combined with -O to instruct Nmap not to OS scan hosts that do not meet this criteria. The -v option can be combined with -O to display additional information
* Submit  TCP/IP Fingerprints 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -O  	www.nmap.org/submit/  If Nmap is unable to determine the operating system on a target, it will provide a fingerprint which can be submitted to Nmap’s OS database at www.nmap.org/submit/. The example below demonstrates Nmap’s output in this scenario. 
* Attempt to Guess an Unknown  OS	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -O --osscan-guess 	Displays a list of possible matches for the target’s operating system
* Service Version Detection  	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -sV 	Nmap version detection purposely skips some problematic ports (specifically 9100-9107). This can be overridden by combining the --allports parameter with -sV which instructs Nmap not to exclude any ports from version detection
* Troubleshooting Version Scans 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -sV --version-trace	The --version-trace option can be helpful for debugging problems or to gain additional information about the target system
* Perform a RPC Scan 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -sR 	The -sR option performs a RPC (Remote Procedure Call) scan on the specified target. 

## Timing Options

* Timing Templates      	#nmap 10.10.10.10 -T0
* #nmap 10.10.10.10 -T1
* #nmap 10.10.10.10 -T2
* #nmap 10.10.10.10 -T3
* #nmap 10.10.10.10 -T4
* #nmap 10.10.10.10 -T5	All timing parameters are accepted as milliseconds. 1ms = (1/1000sec), s=seconds, m=minutes, h=hours 
* •	Paranoid: Extremely slowly T0 Evade Firewall
* •	Sneaky: Useful for avoiding intrusion detection systems T1
* •	Polite: Unlikely to interfere with the target system  T2
* •	Normal: This is the default timing template T3
* •	Aggressive: Produces faster results on local networks T4
* •	Insane: Very fast and aggressive scan T5 -->Faster result
* Set the Packet TTL      	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --ttl 500 	The --ttl option is used to specify the TTL (time-to-live) for the specified scan (in milliseconds). Packets sent using this option will have the specified TTL value. This option is useful when scanning targets on slow connections where normal packets may time out before receiving a response. 
* Minimum # of Parallel Operations 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --min-parallelism 25	Nmap automatically adjusts parallel scanning options based on network conditions. This command instructs nmap to perform 25 parallel operations at any given time. Setting it high may produce wrong results
* Maximum #  of Parallel Operations 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --max-parallelism 200	--max-parallelism 1 is used to restrict Nmap so that only one operation is performed at a time
* Minimum Host Group Size      	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --min-hostgroup 3	Nmap will perform scans in parallel to save time when scanning multiple targets such as a range or entire subnet. By default, Nmap will automatically adjust the size of the host groups based on the type of scan being performed and network conditions. By specifying the --min-hostgroup option, Nmap will attempt to keep the group sizes above the specified number. 
* Maximum Host Group Size      	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --max-hostgroup 5	--max-hostgroup option controls the maximum number of hosts in a group. 
* Maximum RTT Timeout      	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --initial-rtt-timeout 5000 	The --initial-rtt-timeout option controls the initial RTT (round-trip time) timeout value used by Nmap. 
* retransmissions due to timeouts. By decreasing the value you can speed up scans; but do so with caution. Setting the RTT timeout value too low can negate any potential performance gains and lead to inaccurate results. 
* Initial RTT Timeout      	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --max-rtt-timeout 400 	The --max-rtt-timeout option is used to specify the maximum RTT (Round-Trip Time) timeout for a packet response. Nmap dynamically adjusts RTT timeout options for best results by default. The default maximum RTT timeout is 10 seconds. Manually adjusting the maximum RTT timeout lower will allow for faster scan times (especially when scanning large blocks of addresses). Specifying a high maximum RTT timeout will prevent Nmap from giving up too soon when scanning over slow/unreliable connections. Typical values are between 100 milliseconds for fast/reliable networks and 10000 milliseconds for slow/unreliable connections. 
* Maximum Retries      	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --max-retries 5  	The --max-retries option is used to control the maximum number of probe retransmissions Nmap will attempt to perform. By default, Nmap will automatically adjust the number of probe retransmissions based on network conditions. The --max-retries option can be used if you want to override the default settings or troubleshoot a connectivity problem. Specifying a high number can increase the time it takes for a scan to complete, but will produce more accurate results. By lowering the --max-retries you can speed up a scan – although you may not get accurate results if Nmap gives up too quickly. 
* Host Timeout      	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --host-timeout 5m	The --host-timeout option causes Nmap to give up on slow hosts after the specified time. A host may take a long time to scan if it is located on a slow or unreliable network. Systems that are protected by rate limiting firewalls may also take a considerable amount of time to scan. The --host-timeout option instructs Nmap to give up on the target system if it fails to complete after the specified time interval. In the above example, the scan takes longer than one minute to complete (as specified by the 1m parameter) which causes Nmap to terminate the scan. This option is particularly useful when scanning multiple systems across a WAN or internet connection. Nmap performs parallel operations when scanning multiple targets. In the event that one host is taking a long time to respond, Nmap is likely scanning other hosts during that time. This reduces potential bottlenecks that slow hosts can create
* Minimum Scan Delay  	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --scan-delay 5s	The --scan-delay option instructs Nmap to pause for the specified time interval between probes. Some systems employ rate limiting which can hamper Nmap scanning attempts. Nmap will automatically adjust the scan delay by default on systems where rate limiting is detected. In some cases it may be useful to specify your own scan delay if you know that rate limiting or IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) are in use. In the example above the scan delay of 5s instructs Nmap to wait five seconds between probes. 
* Maximum Scan Delay  	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --max-scan-delay 10s 	The --max-scan-delay is used to specify the maximum amount of time Nmap should wait between probes
* Minimum Packet Rate  	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --min-rate 30 	The --min-rate option is used to specify the minimum number of packets Nmap should send per second. Nmap, by default, will automatically adjust the packet rate for a scan based on network conditions. In some cases, you may want to specify your own minimum rate - although this is generally not recommended. In the above example --min-rate 30 instructs Nmap to send at least 30 packets per a second. Nmap will use the number as a low threshold but may scan faster than this if network conditions allow. 
* Maximum Packet Rate      	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --max-rate 50 	The --max-rate option is used to specify the maximum number of packets Nmap should send per second. To perform a very sneaky scan use --max-rate 0.1 which instructs Nmap to send one packet every ten seconds. 
* Defeat Reset Rate Limits 	#nmap 10.10.10.10 --defeat-rst-ratelimit 	The --defeat-rst-ratelimit is used to defeat targets that apply rate limiting to RST (reset) packets. The --defeat-rst-ratelimit option can be useful if you want to speed up scans on targets that implement RST packet rate limits. It can, however, lead to inaccurate results and as such it is rarely used.  The --defeat-rst-ratelimit option is rarely used because, in most cases, Nmap will automatically detect rate limiting hosts and adjust itself accordingly.
